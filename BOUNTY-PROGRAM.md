## Bounty Selection and Proposal Process

1. **Predefined Bounties**: Explore our list of predefined bounties on the GitHub repository's Issues page. These are tagged with the "bounty" label.

2. **Custom suggestions for Security-related Bugs**: If you have a security-related bug you would like to fix, please send an email to: <info@envisionblockchain.com>

3. **Non-Security-related Custom Proposals**: We encourage innovative ideas. If you have a suggestion for an improvement or feature that is not listed in our pre-defined bounties, please follow these steps:
   - Create a new issue on our GitHub repository with the title format: "[BOUNTY PROPOSAL] Your Idea Title"
   - In the issue description, provide:
      - A detailed description of your proposed improvement or feature
      - The potential impact on the project
      - An estimate of the work involved
      - Any relevant technical details or mock-ups
   - Add the "bounty-proposal" label to your issue
   - Wait for the maintainers to review your proposal. We aim to respond within 5 business days.
   - If approved, we'll add the "bounty" label and assign a bounty value, and you can begin working on it.

Note: Always create and discuss a proposal before working on a custom idea. This ensures your effort aligns with project goals, and you are eligible for a bounty.

## Participation Process

1. Select a bounty from the predefined list or get approval for your custom proposal.
2. Fork the `develop` branch of the Guardian repository to your GitHub account.
3. Create a new branch in your fork for the specific bounty you're working on.
4. Comment on the bounty issue to express your interest and mention that you've started working on it. This step is optional, but it would benefit all participants to know how many people are already working on the same topic. There's no limit to the number of competing people working on the same topic.
5. Implement your solution, ensuring all code and documentation meet our project standards.
6. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
7. Submit a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `develop` branch of Guardian main repository (<https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian>).
   - Ensure your PR title includes the bounty identifier (e.g., "BOUNTY-123: Implement feature X"), where `123` is the bounty issue number.
   - In the PR description, reference the same bounty issue number using GitHub's syntax (e.g., "Closes #456")
8. Wait for the maintainer's review. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.
9. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the `develop` branch.
10. Upon successful merge and verification, wait for the winner's announcement and receive your reward!

Note: Only pull requests submitted to the `develop` branch are eligible for bounties. Submissions to other branches will not be accepted unless explicitly allowed by the repository maintainers.
