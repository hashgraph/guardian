Methodology name: ACM0001 (Flaring or use of landfill gas)

Typical project(s): Capture of landfill gas (LFG) and its flaring and/or use to produce energy and/or use to
supply consumers through natural gas distribution network or trucks

Type of GHG emissions mitigation action: 
GHG destruction.
Destruction of methane emissions and displacement of a more-GHG-intensive service

Important conditions under which the methodology is applicable: 
• Captured landfill gas is flared, and/or;
• Captured landfill gas is used to produce energy, and or;
• Captured gas is used to supply consumers through natural gas distribution network,
trucks or the dedicated pipeline.

Important parameters: 
Monitored:
• Amount of landfill gas captured;
• Methane fraction in the landfill gas;
• If applicable: electricity generation using landfill gas.
