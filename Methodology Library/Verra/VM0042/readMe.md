## Verra VM0042 REDD+ Methodology

**Policy Description**: 

The Verra VM0042 methodology is used to calculate the emissions reductions and carbon storage increases that result from using improved land management practices in agriculture. It takes into account emissions from fossil fuel combustion, manure deposition, biomass burning, and nitrogen fertilizers. Improved land management practices can include reducing the use of fertilizers and tillage, improving water management, managing crop residue, planting, and harvesting cover crops, and improving grazing practices. Currently, there are 35 VM0042 projects listed on Verraâ€™s registry and a total of 21,722,438 (tCO2e) estimated annual emission reductions


**Workflow Description**:

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting the project description (PD) to Verra. The project description will include ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters, as well as other project details to demonstrate alignment with the VCS program requirements. Verra then adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry. Next the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will assess and validate the PD and provide a Validation Report. Then the Project Proponent will conduct monitoring and develop a Monitoring Report, replacing the ex-ante estimates with ex-post MRV data and submit it to the VVB. The VVB then verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement. Finally, Verra reviews the issuance request and VCUs and are issued to the Project Proponent.

In future iterations, the workflow will begin with the Project Proponent completing a questionnaire to determine the appropriate methodology, modules, and MRV requirements. Then branch functionality can enable the automatic creation of context-specific schemas.

Roles in the below Workflow Diagram are represented as follows : Project Proponent (Blue), Verra (Orange), VVB (Green)

**Note** :
For Demo purpose, we have uploaded Verra Policies into IPFS and created Timestamps, which are mentioned in the below table.
