## Methodology for Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation Projects v0.1

**Policy Description**: 

The Verra Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) methodology not only quantifies the carbon removal potential of afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects, but it also takes into account the emissions resulting from the burning of biomass and the use of nitrogen fertilizer. This comprehensive approach ensures that the net GHG emissions reduction resulting from the project is accurately quantified, verified, and credited. The methodology establishes guidelines for project design, implementation, and monitoring to assess the project's impact on local biodiversity and social and economic conditions, as well as address potential risks. The methodology promotes sustainable land use practices that contribute to mitigating climate change, support the conservation of biodiversity, and incentivize the adoption of more sustainable land use practices.
The Verra Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) methodology is a newly developed set of guidelines and procedures by Verra for quantifying and verifying greenhouse gas emissions reductions resulting from afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects. The methodology is still under development and has not yet been released.

**Workflow Description**:

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting the project description (PD) to Verra. The project description will include ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters, as well as other project details to demonstrate alignment with the VCS program requirements. Verra then adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry. Next the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will assess and validate the PD and provide a Validation Report. Then the Project Proponent will conduct monitoring and develop a Monitoring Report, replacing the ex-ante estimates with ex-post MRV data and submit it to the VVB. The VVB then verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement. Finally, Verra reviews the issuance request and VCUs and are issued to the Project Proponent.

In future iterations, the workflow will begin with the Project Proponent completing a questionnaire to determine the appropriate methodology, modules, and MRV requirements. Then branch functionality can enable the automatic creation of context-specific schemas.

Roles in the below Workflow Diagram are represented as follows : Project Proponent (Blue), Verra (Orange), VVB (Green)
