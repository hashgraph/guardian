### Introduction

This policy focuses on the VMR0006 methodology, "Energy Efficiency and Fuel Switch Measures in Thermal Applications, v1.2." Developed as an extension of CDM’s AMS-II.G, VMR0006 is particularly relevant for improved cookstove projects. This methodology revision aims to provide monitoring parameters and quantification methods, resulting in emission reductions. It provides alternative methods for monitoring parameters and quantifying emission reductions, largely allowing for the increased use of defaults and less frequent monitoring, therefore, maintaining lower project costs.

### Need and use

The VMR0006 methodology can be used by project developers working on improved cookstove projects. By utilizing default values and less frequent monitoring, VMR0006 helps reduce project costs while ensuring reliable data. The methodology focuses on several key areas, including adoption, usage, stacking (the use of multiple types of stoves within the same household), fuel consumption, fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB), and emission factors.

VMR0006 uses short cross-sectional surveys to establish adoption, usage, and stacking rates, similar to AMS-II.G but with more lenient monitoring requirements. Fuel consumption is determined using default values, historical data, or project-led surveys, with options for annual water boil tests to obtain stove efficiency or assume default efficiency depreciation rates. The methodology directs projects to use global averages, CDM’s Tool 33, or CDM's Tool 30 for fNRB, with a 26% emission reduction discount for using Tool 30. Emission factors include point-of-use and upstream emissions for various gases, using IPCC values, which may lead to larger over-crediting compared to AMS-II.G. Rebound effects in the carbon market refer to increased technology usage due to improved energy efficiency, which can lead to higher overall emissions and offset some anticipated savings. In this methodology, rebound effects are not captured, leading to similar over-crediting. Additionality is granted if stoves are free or use the CDM's tool for demonstration, with leakage adjustments like AMS-II.G.

### Standard Stove Performance Testing

Monitoring and evaluating improved cookstove performance is crucial for developing effective cookstove programs. There are three main types of stove performance tests: Water Boiling Test (WBT), Controlled Cooking Test (CCT), and Kitchen Performance Test (KPT).

**Water Boiling Test (WBT)**: WBT is a laboratory test that evaluates stove performance during a controlled task (boiling and simmering water). It is simple, quick, and cost-effective but does not accurately reflect real cooking conditions. WBT is conducted by trained technicians in a controlled environment, revealing technical performance rather than actual household use.

**Controlled Cooking Test (CCT)**: CCT measures stove performance when a local meal is prepared, either in a lab or field setting. It assesses performance under ideal conditions, simulating local practices. However, CCT still doesn't capture the full range of real-world variables like fuel variability and operator behavior differences.

**Kitchen Performance Test (KPT)**: KPT is the primary field test used to evaluate stove performance in real-world settings, conducted in users' homes to assess actual impacts on household fuel consumption. KPTs provide the most accurate understanding of stove performance but are labor-intensive and intrusive, with results influenced by the less controlled environment.

Overall, improved cookstove performance testing involves balancing logistical complexities and realistic reflection of outcomes. While each test type has strengths and weaknesses, a combination of laboratory and field testing is recommended for comprehensive evaluation. This approach ensures that performance testing accounts for local food preparation and real-world usage, enhancing the reliability of results.



### Different Cookstove Methodologies: Pros and Cons

**VMR0006**: VMR0006 provides a cost-effective solution by utilizing default values and less frequent monitoring, which helps reduce project costs while maintaining reliable data. However, this approach may not capture real-time variations in fuel use and emissions as precisely as continuous monitoring methods.

**Gold Standard Metered Methodology**: The Gold Standard Metered Methodology offers robust monitoring of stove usage and fuel consumption, ensuring high data accuracy and transparency. However, it involves higher costs due to the need for continuous monitoring equipment and may require more technical expertise to implement.

**Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) AMS-II.G**: The CDM AMS-II.G methodology is well-established and widely recognized, using conservative estimates to ensure credibility. However, it can be complex and costly to implement due to rigorous data requirements and may not be as flexible as other methodologies in adapting to local conditions.

The project proponent initiates the process by creating a project design document (VMR0006) for Verra, which includes details such as project description, additionality demonstration, baseline scenario, and estimated emission reductions. Verra and the Validation/Verification Body (VVB) review the project design document. Once approved, Emission reduction credits (ERC) are issued by Verra. The project is then added to the registry, and the project activities are monitored as per the VMR0006 guidelines. The monitored parameters are documented in a monitoring report, which is reviewed by the VVB. After successful review, the project is added to the project pipeline for further processing.

### Overview of Cookstove Methodologies

Various methodologies are used to quantify emissions reductions in cookstove projects, each with its own approach to monitoring and verification. These methodologies include cross-sectional surveys, kitchen performance tests (KPTs), and continuous monitoring systems (CMS). Cross-sectional surveys and KPTs are commonly used to gather data on stove adoption, usage, and fuel consumption, while CMS provides real-time data but at a higher cost. The methodologies also address issues such as stove stacking, rebound effects, and leakage to ensure accurate emissions reductions. More details on these methodologies can be found on the [Berkeley Carbon Trading Project's website](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project/cookstoves/how-the-methodologies-work).

### Policy Import

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPSF timestamp.


### Available roles

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the energy efficiency or fuel switch project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VMR0006 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities, such as device distribution, biomass consumption, and emission reductions achieved. Upon successful validation and verification, the project proponent receives Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) as an incentive for their emission reductions.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VMR0006 guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration and credit issuance.

3. **Registry (Verra)** – Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports. This process ensures that energy efficiency and fuel switch projects meet the VMR0006 methodology requirements before Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) are issued. Verra also oversees the issuance of ERCs to approved projects.
