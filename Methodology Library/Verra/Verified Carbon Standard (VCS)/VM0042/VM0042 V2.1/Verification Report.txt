  "G18": "A description of the verification of the project: The verification process involved an independent assessment of the project's compliance with the VCS Program requirements, including a review of monitoring reports, project documentation, and relevant supporting materials. This process also included site visits, interviews with key personnel, and cross-checking the data provided by the project proponent to ensure the accuracy and completeness of reported emissions reductions.  The purpose and scope of verification: The primary purpose of the verification was to determine whether the project meets the necessary standards set out by the VCS Program for carbon credit issuance. The scope of the verification included an evaluation of the project’s emissions reductions, adherence to the approved methodology, and overall project documentation. The verification also assessed the accuracy of data inputs, monitoring systems, and the project's alignment with the emissions reduction goals.  The monitoring period: The monitoring period for this verification spanned from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. During this period, the project implemented its emissions reduction activities, and the verification covered all relevant data for this time frame.  The method and criteria used for verification: The verification followed a risk-based approach, using a combination of document reviews, on-site inspections, and interviews to verify the project’s compliance. The criteria for verification included the VCS Program standards, the approved methodology for the project type, and any additional requirements specified in the project’s PDD (Project Design Document). Evidence was gathered through both desk reviews and direct assessments during the site visit.  The number of findings raised during verification: During the verification process, a total of four findings were raised. These included two corrective action requests, one clarification request, and one forward action request. Each finding was addressed in a timely manner by the project proponent, and all necessary corrections were made.  Any uncertainties associated with the verification: There were minor uncertainties identified related to the estimation of leakage emissions, particularly regarding the potential for unforeseen indirect emissions linked to the project’s implementation. However, the project proponent has taken steps to address these uncertainties by updating their leakage management plan and providing additional data on relevant emission factors.  Summary of the verification conclusion: The verification concluded that the project is in conformance with all applicable VCS Program requirements.

Risks include potential changes in land use, legal or policy changes, natural disasters (e.g., fires, floods), and ongoing maintenance and monitoring challenges.  Assessment of Rationale, Assumptions, and Justifications Rationale and Assumptions:  The project’s non-permanence risk score was determined based on historical data and expert assessments, taking into account past performance of similar projects in the region and the local environmental conditions.  Assumptions included the expected effectiveness of mitigation measures, such as fire prevention protocols and ecosystem restoration efforts, and the stability of land tenure and legal protections for the project area.  Justifications:  The risk score is justified based on the thorough monitoring plan in place to mitigate risks like invasive species and ecosystem degradation. The risk of reforestation failure was considered low, given the species' proven adaptability to local conditions.  Quality of Documentation and Data Documentation and Data Assessment:  All data used to support the non-permanence risk rating were sourced from credible and verifiable studies, including baseline environmental assessments, land use history, and expert opinions.  Documentation on mitigation measures, including insurance and legal agreements related to land tenure, was provided and verified.  Data Quality and Sources:  The quality of the data was assessed, ensuring it was current, sourced from reputable institutions, and aligned with best practices for risk analysis.  Environmental monitoring data, historical climate patterns, and land use changes were integrated into the risk rating analysis.  Conclusion on Risk Rating Appropriateness Conclusion:  The non-permanence risk rating assigned by the project proponent is appropriate based on the comprehensive analysis of risks and the quality of supporting documentation. The mitigation strategies in place significantly reduce risks such as ecosystem degradation, policy changes, or natural disasters.  The overall risk rating was determined to be moderate, with the acknowledgment that unforeseen events (e.g., extreme weather) could still pose a risk, but the project’s management practices mitigate such risks effectively.",

Validation and Verification Standards:  The audit included activities to confirm that the project conforms with the validation criteria for projects as set out in VCS Version 4. The validation was conducted in accordance with ISO 14064-3: 2019, as required.  The verification was performed by an accredited validation/verification body approved by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).",
