## Introduction

Verra Methodologies are essential to quantifying real and accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of a project and to generate Verified Carbon Units (VCUs). Methodologies provide requirements and procedures to determine project boundaries, identify the baseline, assess additionality, monitor the relevant parameters, and ultimately quantify the GHG emission reductions or removals.

Methodologies often refer to modules or tools, which include specific methodological tasks and analyses (e.g., additionality) that are used in conjunction with the methodology.
