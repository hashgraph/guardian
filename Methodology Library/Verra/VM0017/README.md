## Verra VM0017 REDD+ Methodology

**Policy Description**: 

The Verra VM0017 methodology is used to measure the emissions reductions that result from sustainable land management in agriculture. VM0017 can be used to monitor the emissions reductions that result from various project activities that increase the amount of carbon stored in agricultural areas. These activities can include the use of cover crops, improved farming techniques, and agroforestry. This methodology can be used in different agricultural regions, but it only applies in situations where the soil organic carbon levels would stay the same or decrease without the project. Currently, there are 26 VM0017 projects listed on Verraâ€™s registry and a total of 10,457,449 (tCO2e) estimated annual emission reductions."

The workflow is designed to reflect the general roles and processes of the VCS program. The VM0017 REDD is a dynamic modular methodology, and the specific requirements vary depending on the specific project activities and context. The schema was designed to capture the monitoring parameters required for the Avoiding Planned Deforestation (ADP) project type. Projects that involve other project types, and specific contexts, such as projects that involve harvesting commercial timber, may have additional parameter and MRV requirements. 


**Workflow Description**:

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting the project description (PD) to Verra. The project description will include ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters, as well as other project details to demonstrate alignment with the VCS program requirements. Verra then adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry. Next the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will assess and validate the PD and provide a Validation Report. Then the Project Proponent will conduct monitoring and develop a Monitoring Report, replacing the ex-ante estimates with ex-post MRV data and submit it to the VVB. The VVB then verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement. Finally, Verra reviews the issuance request and VCUs and are issued to the Project Proponent.

In future iterations, the workflow will begin with the Project Proponent completing a questionnaire to determine the appropriate methodology, modules, and MRV requirements. Then branch functionality can enable the automatic creation of context-specific schemas.

Roles in the below Workflow Diagram are represented as follows : Project Proponent (Blue), Verra (Orange), VVB (Green)
