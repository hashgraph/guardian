# Verra VT0001 Additionality Tool

The Verra Tool for the "Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in VCS Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities, v3.0" is a standardized approach designed to evaluate whether AFOLU projects under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) meet the criteria for additionality. This tool ensures that project activities produce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals that would not have occurred under a "business as usual" scenario. It includes guidance on conducting regulatory surplus tests, financial feasibility analyses, and common practice assessments to demonstrate that the project activities are genuinely unique and contribute to environmental integrity.

This tool is adapted from the CDM Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality in A/R CDM project activities.

## Scope and Applicability

### Scope

This tool outlines a step-by-step process to demonstrate additionality in VCS AFOLU projects. Project proponents developing new baseline methodologies can integrate this tool into their proposals. Alternatively, proponents may propose other methods for demonstrating additionality in line with the latest version of the VCS, subject to approval through the VCS methodology review process. 

When validating the use of this tool for a proposed project, validation and verification bodies must evaluate the credibility of all data, rationales, assumptions, justifications, and documentation provided by project proponents to support both the baseline selection and the demonstration of additionality.

### Applicability

This tool is applicable under the following conditions:  

1. AFOLU activities, whether the same as or similar to the proposed project activity and occurring within the project boundary, must not result in a violation of any applicable laws, regardless of whether such laws are actively enforced.  
2. The application of this tool for determining additionality requires that the baseline methodology incorporates a stepwise approach to justify the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario. Proponents developing new baseline methodologies must ensure alignment between the determination of the baseline scenario and the demonstration of the project activity's additionality.  

## Procedure

1. Identify **alternative land-use scenarios** to the AFOLU project activity.  
2. Conduct an **investment analysis** to demonstrate that the proposed project activity is not the most economically or financially attractive option among the identified land-use scenarios.  
3. Perform a **barriers analysis** to identify any significant obstacles preventing the implementation of the proposed project activity.  
4. Undertake a **common practice analysis** to evaluate whether the proposed project activity deviates from typical practices in the region or sector.

## Importance in Verra Projects


The Verra Tool for demonstrating additionality is a critical component of Verra projects, particularly within the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. It ensures that project activities go beyond "business as usual" scenarios, delivering genuine and measurable greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals. By standardizing the additionality assessment, the tool enhances the credibility, transparency, and environmental integrity of Verra projects.  

This rigorous process helps project proponents establish the uniqueness and necessity of their interventions while aligning with Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) requirements. It also provides validation and verification bodies with a clear framework for assessing compliance, ensuring that Verra projects maintain their reputation as robust and impactful climate solutions in the global carbon market.

## Conclusion

The Verra Tool for demonstrating additionality is an essential resource for ensuring the environmental and financial integrity of VCS AFOLU projects. By providing a structured approach to assess and validate project additionality, it safeguards the credibility of carbon offset activities while fostering transparency and accountability. Its rigorous methodology helps project proponents justify their initiatives and ensures that only impactful projects contribute to the global fight against climate change. Proper application of this tool strengthens the reliability of Verra-certified projects, reinforcing their role in advancing sustainable land-use practices and driving meaningful climate action.
