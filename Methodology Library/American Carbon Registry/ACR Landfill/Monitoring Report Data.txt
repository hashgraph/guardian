  "G27": "The Project Activity is the operation of an active landfill gas collection and flare destruction system at the Loess Hills Regional Sanitary Landfill, which reduces emissions of methane to the atmosphere. Total GHG Emissions Reductions achieved are 228,571 metric tons of CO2-equivalents. ",

  "G30": "ACR has approved of three deviation requests. The deviation request submitted on October 19, 2023 allowed for the use of the minimum methane concentation measurement during periods in which continuous methane concentration measurements were unavailable. Using the minimum methane concentration measurement when other data is not available was conservative. The deviation request submitted on February 09, 2024 allowed for LoCI to use automated calibration proceedure of the methane sensor. The data collected by the sensor was conservative. The other deviation request submitted on February 11, 2024 allowed for LoCI to use the data from a GEM5000 even though the interval of calibration exceeded the manufacturer's recommendation. Despite the calibration interval exceeding the recommendation, when the device was calibrated, it was found to be accurately reading, therefore data collected was conservative. ",
  "G31": "SDG #7 Affordable and Clean Energy, Target 7.a – The Project creates reliable, high-quality gas that is currently destroyed to reduce fugitive emissions. Maintaining a stable LFG resource encourages development of downstream renewable energy.  SDG #9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, Target 9.4 – The Project has been enhanced by the addition of the Green automated monitoring and control system. Green Energy Solutions provides an automated gas control system that is an innovative technology supporting environmental infrastructure for the landfill industry. The system increases the frequency of monitoring gas characteristics and adjusts vacuum control as needed, sometimes hourly, compared to the monthly manual monitoring required by regulations. The system also alerts for irregularities, allowing quick corrections to prevent methane leakage.  SDG #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, Target 11.6 – Communities produce waste; the Project increases the sustainability of waste disposal by enabling greater resource capture for reuse. Collecting this gas improves air quality in surrounding communities and reduces fugitive emissions, which would otherwise escape from the landfill surface. Enhanced gas collection lowers greenhouse gas emissions and other minor constituents, including hazardous air pollutants, and mitigates odor migration.  SDG #12 Sustainable Consumption and Production, Targets 12.4 & 12.6 – The Project adopts sustainable consumption and production patterns where feasible. It uses solar rechargeable lithium-powered equipment, with batteries sustainably disposed of at the end of their life cycle. Calibration gas canisters used for equipment calibration are returned to the supplier for reuse once depleted.  SDG #13 Climate Action, Target 13.2 – The Project supports sustainable development in the U.S. by increasing landfill gas collection for renewable energy projects. As industry members and partners, Green Energy Solutions and Iowa Environmental Services LLC contribute to the U.S. climate action goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy initiatives.",
