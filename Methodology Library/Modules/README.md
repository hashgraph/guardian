## Modules

**Policy Modules**: 

Policy Modules are large-scale components of the policy containing multiple blocks and internal events. Modules expose external interfaces through which they interoperate with the rest of the policy (blocks).

*Following operations can be performed*:
- Managing Modules
  - Creating Modules
  - Importing Modules
  - Exporting Modules
  - Deleting Modules
  - Editing Modules
 
**Modules Structure**: 

The ‘insides’ of modules are isolated from the rest of Policy it may be embedded into. The external view of a module is represented by Variables and Input\Output Events, which serve as an interface of the Module and transmit data into and out of the module.
