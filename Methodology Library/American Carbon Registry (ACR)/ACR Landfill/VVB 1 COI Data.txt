  "G39": "ndependent Review Board: The VVB has an independent review board that oversees all assessments to ensure impartiality. Members of the board are selected based on their expertise and are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest prior to engagement.  Conflict of Interest Policy: A strict conflict of interest policy is enforced, which mandates all staff, auditors, and contractors to declare any personal, financial, or professional relationships that may influence their judgment or impartiality. This declaration is reviewed regularly.  Segregation of Duties: The VVB ensures the segregation of duties across different phases of the project to prevent any overlap that could lead to a conflict of interest. For example, project assessment teams are distinct from those involved in decision-making or approval processes.  Ongoing Training: Regular training is provided to all staff on conflict of interest awareness and the procedures to follow in case of a potential conflict. This ensures all team members are aligned with the VVB’s commitment to transparency and fairness.  Whistleblower Mechanism: A confidential whistleblower mechanism is in place, allowing individuals to report any concerns regarding conflicts of interest without fear of retaliation. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a dedicated ethics committee.  Third-Party Audits: Regular third-party audits are conducted to ensure compliance with internal conflict of interest policies. These audits help maintain objectivity and transparency in the VVB’s operations.",
  "G40": "After thorough review and consideration, it is determined that there are no potential or actual conflicts of interest that would impact the VVB’s ability to provide impartial validation and verification services for the GHG Project.  The VVB has no financial interests, previous relationships, or personal ties to the project developer or any associated parties that would influence the outcome of the validation or verification process. Additionally, the VVB is not providing any advisory or consulting services to the project, ensuring complete independence in the validation and verification activities.  All staff and auditors involved in the project have declared no conflicts of interest, and appropriate segregation of duties is maintained throughout the process. The VVB’s strict conflict of interest policy ensures that the validation and verification process is conducted with the highest level of impartiality and transparency.  Therefore, the VVB can confirm that there are no conflicts of interest that would affect the integrity of the GHG Project validation and verification services.",
  "G42": "The VVB has verified the project for a total of 3 consecutive years of reporting, including the initial and renewed Crediting Periods. These verifications have been conducted in accordance with the established methodologies and reporting periods for the GHG project.  For projects developed under a methodology that dictates a single reporting period, the VVB has validated and verified the following five single reporting period ACR projects for the Project Proponent:  Project Name – Validation/Verification Date: January 2022 Project Name – Validation/Verification Date: June 2022 Project Name – Validation/Verification Date: November 2022 Project Name – Validation/Verification Date: April 2023 Project Name – Validation/Verification Date: September 2023 These verifications were carried out in line with the approved methodologies, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all reporting periods for the Project Proponent.",
  "G43": [
    "In the case of project types with only one Reporting Period that have occurred at the same facility, the VVB has performed 7 of the last 9 verifications for projects developed at this facility. These verifications were carried out in accordance with the relevant methodologies and have ensured the accuracy and integrity of the emissions reductions reported for each project.  Each verification was conducted independently and thoroughly to maintain the highest standards of transparency and compliance with applicable regulations."
