## Introduction

This document outlines the Guardian policy created I accordance to the ACR Landfill Gas Methodology v2.0, titled “Methodology for the Quantification, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions and Removals from Landfill Gas Destruction and Beneficial Use Projects.” Developed by the American Carbon Registry (ACR), this methodology offers a comprehensive framework for quantifying emissions reductions through the destruction or utilization of landfill gas (LFG). By converting methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into energy or other beneficial uses, this methodology provides a robust pathway for generating high-quality carbon offset credits.

## Need and Use

This methodology supports project developers aiming to reduce methane emissions from municipal solid waste landfills by capturing and converting LFG. It establishes clear protocols for baseline emissions, additionality, monitoring, and verification, ensuring accurate accounting and credit generation. It also provides flexibility for the inclusion of innovative technologies, such as automated gas collection systems, to enhance collection efficiency.

The framework enables projects to:

a. Quantify methane destruction and beneficial uses.

b. Generate credible and tradable carbon offset credits.

c. Encourage environmentally sustainable and economically viable landfill management practices.

## U.S. Landfills and Methane Collection Benefits

Landfills in the United States are a significant source of methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 to 36 times greater than carbon dioxide over 100 years. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), municipal solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the country. Capturing and utilizing landfill gas (LFG), which consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide, offers substantial environmental and economic benefits. Methane collection systems reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve local air quality, and mitigate odor issues. Additionally, captured methane can be converted into renewable energy or processed for injection into natural gas pipelines, providing a sustainable energy source while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. These practices not only contribute to climate change mitigation but also support a circular economy by turning waste into valuable resources. 

## Monitoring and Quantification Approach

Key components of the monitoring and quantification process include:

1. LFG Collection and Destruction: Continuous monitoring of gas flow and methane content using calibrated devices.
   
2. Baseline Emissions: Determined using modeled or measured methane generation and collection efficiency data.
   
3. Emission Reductions: Quantified by subtracting project emissions (e.g., from fossil fuel combustion or electricity use) from baseline emissions.

4. Leakage: Leakage emissions are deemed negligible under this methodology.
   
The methodology provides default factors and customizable parameters, ensuring flexibility while maintaining data accuracy and transparency.

## Project Eligibility and Additionality

Eligible projects under this methodology include:

- Destruction of LFG using open or enclosed flares.
  
- Conversion of LFG to energy in turbines, boilers, or engines.
  
- Injection of processed LFG into natural gas pipelines.
  
- Use of automated gas collection systems to enhance collection efficiency.
  
Additionality must be demonstrated using one of the following approaches:

- A performance-based standard combined with a regulatory surplus test.
  
- ACR’s three-prong additionality test, addressing regulatory surplus, common practice, and financial barriers.

21. The Administrator can review the Verification Opinion. The actions available for this document differ from the previous ones, as it is the document we will mint credits against. You’ll see three buttons: Mint, Close, and Reject. The Mint button allows you to select the Vintage for which you would like to mint credits. The Close button should be used once all applicable Vintages have been used for minting credits. The Reject button can be used if the Verification Opinion is not acceptable. Below, we will display an example to showcase what happens when we select ‘Mint’ and define a Vintage (e.g., 2021).
