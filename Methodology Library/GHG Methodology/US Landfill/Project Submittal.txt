  "G26": "The EWMF Landfill Gas Destruction Project captures and destroys methane gas generated at Johnson County Landfill. The project involves the installation of a gas collection and control system (GCCS) to capture landfill gas (LFG) and a high-temperature flare for methane destruction. This system is expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by converting methane into CO2, a less potent GHG. This project aims to contribute to the local governmentâ€™s environmental sustainability goals while generating carbon credits. The landfill is designed to accommodate municipal solid waste (MSW) and is projected to remain operational until 2030. EWMF's project is in line with regulatory requirements and adheres to best practices for landfill gas management.",
