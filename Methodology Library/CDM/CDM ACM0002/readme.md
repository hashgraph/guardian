## Introduction

With mounting concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the imperative to mitigate climate change, ACM0002 has been developed within the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At its essence, ACM0002 centers on grid-connected electricity generation sourced from renewable and environmentally responsible sources, ushering in a transformative era of clean, sustainable energy production. 

This methodology is designed to focus on projects that aim to replace or retrofit existing power plants or construct new units, all fueled by renewable energy sources, while simultaneously supplying electricity to the grid. ACM0002's is used to quantify and verify greenhouse gas emissions reductions, thereby reducing the carbon footprint associated with electricity generation. It acknowledges the pressing need to shift away from GHG-intensive energy sources and transition towards a greener, more sustainable energy mix. 

ACM0002 commits to harnessing the immense potential of renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar photovoltaic, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal power generation. This methodology introduces a standardized framework for assessing and verifying emissions reductions, ultimately contributing to global efforts to combat climate change. ACM0002 is built with a suite of essential methodological tools and schemas, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of emissions calculations. 

## Need and Use for the ACM0002 Policy

This methodology is specifically tailored to accommodate a spectrum of essential projects, including retrofitting, rehabilitation, replacement, or capacity addition to existing power plants, as well as the construction and operation of new power plants or units, all powered by renewable energy sources and connected to the grid. Notably, under certain conditions, ACM0002 also permits the integration of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), enhancing grid stability and optimizing renewable energy utilization. 

To qualify, a project must harness energy from renewable sources such as hydro, wind, geothermal, solar, wave, or tidal power. This selective approach excludes biomass-fired power plants, aligning with the overarching goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, ACM0002 establishes stringent historical reference criteria, requiring that existing power plants commenced commercial operation at least five years before the project's initiation. This standard ensures that no capacity expansion or retrofit, rehabilitation, or replacement of the plant occurred within the specified historical reference period, promoting genuine emissions reductions. 

For hydro power projects, ACM0002 extends its applicability to various scenarios, including those within existing reservoirs with no change in reservoir volume, or integrated hydro power projects spanning multiple reservoirs. This versatility highlights ACM0002's adaptability to diverse renewable energy sources and conditions. Furthermore, integration with a Battery Energy Storage System is permissible, further optimizing the grid's stability and renewable energy utilization, whether for Greenfield renewable energy generation technologies or existing solar photovoltaic or wind power plants. 

## Objective and Scope

The core objective of ACM0002 is to provide a standardized framework for quantifying and verifying GHG emissions reductions or removals attributable to electricity generation projects connected to the grid that harness renewable energy sources. ACM0002 encompasses a wide range of renewable energy technologies, including but not limited to solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal power generation. 

## Methodology Overview

ACM0002 initiates by establishing a baseline against which emissions reductions are assessed. This baseline represents the emissions that would have occurred in the absence of the renewable energy project. The methodology also mandates a demonstration of "additionality," confirming that the project would not have transpired without CDM support.

## Typical Projects

ACM0002 is applicable to a variety of project types, including retrofit, rehabilitation (or refurbishment), replacement, or capacity addition to an existing power plant, as well as the construction and operation of new power plants or units that utilize renewable energy sources and supply electricity to the grid. Under certain conditions, ACM0002 permits the integration of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). 

## Integration of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) 

For projects considering the integration of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), ACM0002 provides guidelines and requirements for incorporating BESS with both Greenfield power plants and existing solar photovoltaic or wind power plants. This addition contributes to grid stability and enables better management of renewable energy fluctuations. 

## Available Roles

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions. 

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration. 

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.
