## Introduction

ACM0018 is dedicated to electricity generation from biomass in power-only plants, developed as a methodology within the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  

This methodology is specifically tailored to projects that focus on the generation of electricity through the utilization of biomass in power-only facilities. Whether it involves constructing new biomass power plants or retrofitting existing ones, ACM0018 places a significant emphasis on harnessing the potential of biomass resources while simultaneously supplying clean electricity to the grid. ACM0018's primary objective is to quantify and verify reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint associated with electricity generation. It highlights the essential need to shift away from carbon-intensive energy sources and make a decisive transition toward a more eco-friendly and sustainable energy landscape. 

ACM0018 commits to the advancement of biomass-based power generation, utilizing a wide range of biomass feedstocks, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and organic materials. This methodology introduces a standardized framework for assessing and verifying emissions reductions, thereby contributing to the global effort towards combating climate change. ACM0018 is equipped with a comprehensive suite of methodological tools and schemas, ensuring the precision and consistency of emissions calculations. 

## Need and Use for the ACM0018 Policy

ACM0018 addresses the critical need for sustainable electricity generation from biomass sources in power-only plants, offering a versatile framework for a range of project activities. Project activities can encompass a variety of actions, such as power capacity expansion, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and the combination of these elements to address specific energy and environmental objectives. ACM0018 provides a structured framework for the quantification and verification of emissions reductions to support sustainable energy practices. 

This methodology facilitates Greenfield Power Project Activities by allowing the installation of new biomass (co-)fired power-only plants in locations without current power generation. This enables the establishment of clean energy infrastructure in areas seeking to kickstart sustainable electricity production. In regions with existing power-only plants utilizing fossil fuels and/or biomass, ACM0018 supports Power Capacity Expansion Project Activities through the installation of new biomass (co-)fired power-only plants. These new facilities can either replace or complement existing ones, significantly increasing power capacity while transitioning to cleaner energy sources. Energy Efficiency Improvement Project Activities are a vital component, promoting enhanced energy efficiency in existing biomass (co-)fired power-only plants. Such improvements can lead to capacity expansion, often achieved through retrofitting, ultimately reducing emissions and advancing sustainable energy generation. 

Additionally, ACM0018 accommodates Fuel Switch Project Activities, encouraging the replacement of fossil fuels with biomass in existing power-only plants. This transition substantially reduces the carbon footprint of electricity generation, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change and promote cleaner energy alternatives. Furthermore, this methodology allows for the installation of biomass (co-)fired power-only plants with integrated solar thermal power generation, expanding the scope of clean energy options for areas where solar thermal technology has yet to be employed. 

## Objective and Scope

ACM0018 seeks to establish a standardized framework for measuring and verifying reductions in greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation from biomass in power-only plants. The primary goal is to advance sustainable energy production while reducing the carbon footprint linked to electricity generation.

## Methodology Overview

ACM0018 is a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology designed to support carbon offset projects that generate electricity from biomass in power-only plants. These projects aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing sustainable biomass resources for power generation.

## Typical Projects

Typical projects following ACM0018 involve the construction and operation of power plants that use biomass, such as wood, agricultural residues, and organic materials, to generate electricity. Various technologies, including combustion engines, steam turbines, and gas turbines, can be employed. The key goal is to reduce emissions compared to a baseline scenario where non-renewable energy sources would have been used for electricity generation.  

## Available Roles

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions. 

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration. 

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.
