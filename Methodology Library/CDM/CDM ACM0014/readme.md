## Introduction
The ACM0014 methodology, titled “Treatment of Wastewater”, provides a framework for quantifying emission reductions from wastewater treatment projects. It applies to activities involving the treatment of wastewater through anaerobic digestion, which captures and flares or utilizes the generated biogas for electricity or heat generation1.

Anaerobic digestion is a process where microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, leading to the production of biogas. This biogas can be used as a renewable energy source, thus reducing reliance on fossil fuels and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The conversion of waste into energy not only mitigates emissions but also contributes to resource efficiency.

ACM0014 ensures the accuracy of baseline emissions calculations from conventional wastewater treatment and the project emissions from the anaerobic treatment system. It also considers leakage emissions that may result from the project activities.

By promoting the adoption of anaerobic digestion technology, ACM0014 aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions and foster sustainable development by enhancing the management and treatment of wastewater resources.

## Need and Use for the ACM0014 Policy

In many regions, especially in developing countries, wastewater management is a significant environmental challenge. Traditional wastewater treatment methods are often energy-intensive and have a high carbon footprint.

The ACM0014 methodology provides a structured approach to quantify emission reductions from projects that treat wastewater through anaerobic digestion. This process not only treats wastewater but also generates biogas, a renewable energy source, which can be used for electricity or heat production, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Implementing projects under ACM0014 can help entities operating wastewater treatment facilities to develop carbon offset projects. The emission reductions achieved can be quantified and potentially registered under carbon crediting programs following independent validation. This can provide an additional revenue stream, improving the financial viability of sustainable wastewater treatment projects.

ACM0014 promotes the transition to low-carbon wastewater treatment technologies, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and supporting sustainable development goals. It offers a viable solution for improving wastewater management while incentivizing the adoption of cleaner technologies through carbon market mechanisms.

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file).

### Available Roles 
 
- Project participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens
