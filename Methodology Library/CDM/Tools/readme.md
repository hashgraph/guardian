## Overview of Tools in the Guardian

Tools are used to calculate, determine, demonstrate, estimate, identify and/or test information relating to a CDM project activity and are usually referenced in an approved methodology or a form. When referenced, all or specified components of the tool are required and mandatory. 

**Defining Characteristics of Tools**

1. **Component-Based Structure:** Unlike Modules, Tools maintain a component-based structure within policies. They are linked to policies through references rather than being fully embedded, maintaining a level of isolation. This design preserves the integrity of their internal mechanics, such as blocks, events, and schemas.

2. **Interface-Driven Interoperability:** Tools are equipped with dedicated interfaces for seamless interaction within the policy ecosystem. These interfaces facilitate effective communication and functionality of Tools alongside other policy content.

3. **Limited Editability:** Tools are designed with restricted editability to maintain their standardized functions. Standard Registries can modify only the external interfaces of Tools, ensuring consistent application and performance in line with established methodologies.

4. **Hierarchical Integration:** Unique to Tools is their ability to encapsulate other Tools, allowing for a hierarchical structure within policies. This feature enables the development of complex, layered policy frameworks where each Tool contributes specific capabilities.
