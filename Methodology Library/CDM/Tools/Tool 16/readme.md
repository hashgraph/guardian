# UNFCCC CDM Tool 16: Methodological Tool for Project and Leakage Emissions from Biomass (Version 05.0)

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 16** is designed for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects utilizing biomass or biomass residues as fuel or feedstock. It offers methodologies to accurately calculate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the cultivation, transportation, and processing of biomass.

## Purpose and Scope

This tool facilitates the calculation of:
- **Project Emissions:** Direct emissions from the use of biomass or residues.
- **Leakage Emissions:** Indirect emissions from activities such as cultivation and transportation of biomass.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Addresses emissions throughout the biomass value chain.
- **Flexibility for Various Biomass Sources:** Applicable to dedicated plantations and residues.
- **Detailed Guidelines:** Provides step-by-step procedures for emission calculations.

## Application Process

1. **Identify Biomass Sources:** Classify whether the biomass is from dedicated plantations or residues.
2. **Calculate Project Emissions:** Estimate emissions from the direct use of biomass.
3. **Assess Leakage Emissions:** Evaluate indirect emissions from biomass cultivation, transportation, and processing.
4. **Document and Report:** Compile calculations for CDM project documentation.

## Importance in CDM Projects

Tool 16 is crucial for:
- Ensuring accurate emission accounting in biomass-related CDM projects.
- Supporting sustainable biomass utilization practices within the CDM framework.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 16** is an essential resource for project developers, enabling precise GHG emission calculations for projects involving biomass, thus contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
