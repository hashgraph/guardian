# UNFCCC CDM Tool 06: Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in A/R CDM Project Activities

The **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Tool 06** is a specialized tool designed to assess and demonstrate the additionality of Afforestation and Reforestation (A/R) project activities under the CDM framework. This tool is crucial for ensuring that A/R CDM projects contribute to genuine, additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals that would not occur in the absence of the project.

## Purpose and Scope

Tool 06 provides a structured approach for determining whether A/R CDM project activities are additional, meaning they result in environmental benefits (i.e., GHG emission reductions or removals) beyond what would happen under a "business-as-usual" scenario. The scope of this tool includes:

- Assessing the financial and economic viability of the A/R project to determine if it would likely proceed without the incentives provided by CDM.
- Evaluating barriers to the implementation of the A/R project that would make it less attractive than other non-CDM alternatives.
- Confirming that the A/R project activity is not common practice in the project area, thus demonstrating its uniqueness and additionality.

## Key Features

- **Structured Additionality Assessment:** Provides a clear, step-by-step process for assessing additionality, including investment analysis, barrier analysis, and common practice analysis specifically tailored for A/R projects.
- **Barrier Analysis:** Helps identify and document barriers (e.g., technical, financial, institutional) that prevent the A/R project from being the most attractive option without CDM incentives.
- **Investment Analysis:** Offers guidance for analyzing the financial and economic feasibility of the A/R project, comparing it with other potential investments.
- **Common Practice Analysis:** Examines whether similar A/R activities are already common in the project area, contributing to the demonstration of additionality.

## Application Process

The application of Tool 06 involves several critical steps:

1. **Preliminary Screening:** Determine if the A/R project activity qualifies for simplified procedures for demonstrating additionality.
2. **Apply Additionality Assessment:** Choose and apply the most appropriate method (investment analysis, barrier analysis, or both) to assess additionality.
3. **Perform Common Practice Analysis:** Conduct an analysis to ensure the project activity is not a common practice in the relevant area.
4. **Document and Report:** Carefully document the additionality assessment process and include this information in the CDM project documentation for validation and verification.

## Importance in CDM Projects

Tool 06 is vital for:

- Ensuring that A/R CDM projects result in real, measurable, and additional environmental benefits.
- Maintaining the integrity and credibility of the CDM mechanism by rigorously assessing the additionality of A/R projects.
- Facilitating the acceptance and registration of A/R CDM projects by providing a clear framework for demonstrating additionality.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 06: Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in A/R CDM Project Activities** is essential for project developers and stakeholders involved in A/R CDM projects. By offering a detailed methodology for demonstrating additionality, Tool 06 ensures that A/R projects effectively contribute to GHG emission reductions or removals, aligning with the goals of sustainable development and climate change mitigation.
