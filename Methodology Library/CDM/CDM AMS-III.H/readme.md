## Introduction

AMS-III.H methodology offers a concrete roadmap for methane recovery in wastewater treatment, thereby contributing significantly to the efforts towards sustainable water management and climate change mitigation. Developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this methodology encourages the substitution of aerobic wastewater or sludge treatment systems with anaerobic systems with biogas recovery and combustion. It also provides guidelines for the introduction of anaerobic sludge treatment systems with biogas recovery and combustion to wastewater treatment plants that previously lacked sludge treatment.

The increasing global concern for climate change and the pivotal role of methane in exacerbating global warming make this methodology indispensable. AMS-III.H provides comprehensive mechanisms for quantifying emissions and the impact of reduction strategies. The methodology promotes the efficient use of biogas recovery and combustion systems in wastewater treatment, which when inadequately harnessed, can lead to significant methane emissions. AMS-III.H aims to prevent these emissions and promote the use of biogas as a sustainable energy source.

AMS-III.H methodology is grounded in an integrated use of various methodological tools, designed to ensure accuracy and consistency in emission calculations. These tools, including standards for calculating baseline, project and leakage emissions from electricity consumption, make the methodology comprehensive and reliable for sustainable wastewater treatment practices.

AMS-III.H brings to the forefront the environmental impact of traditional wastewater treatment practices. By adhering to this methodology, significant reductions in methane emissions can be achieved, leading to sustainable development and environmental preservation.

## Need and Use for the AMS-III.H Policy

Methane emissions from anaerobic wastewater treatment are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in developing countries. Conventional treatment systems like anaerobic lagoons release methane generated during biological decomposition. AMS-III.H serves as a vital alternative, promoting a transition towards sustainable wastewater treatment practices through methane recovery and biogas utilization.

Wastewater treatment is a significant contributor to global methane emissions. AMS-III.H methodology provides a detailed framework for wastewater treatment plants to transition towards more sustainable practices, primarily through methane recovery and biogas utilization. This not only helps in reducing methane emissions but also promotes the use of renewable energy resources, thus contributing positively to global efforts against climate change.

In the modern landscape of emission reduction initiatives, transparency and credibility are key. Guardian Platform, built on Hedera Hashgraph DLT, provides immutable and transparent record-keeping, enhancing the accountability of these initiatives. AMS-III.H, with its focus on sustainable wastewater treatment practices, enhances its environmental impact and underscores the role of innovative technology in driving a greener and more sustainable future.

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPSF timestamp = 1719334963.305320577

### Available Roles 
 
- Project participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens

### Important Documents & Schemas 
  
Project Description: Information on project participant, location, technology, configuration, crediting period etc.

Emission Reductions Calculations: Calculate & specify baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage as per methodology equations.

Monitoring Plan: Description of monitoring approach, parameters, frequency, QA/QC procedures etc. in line with methodology.
