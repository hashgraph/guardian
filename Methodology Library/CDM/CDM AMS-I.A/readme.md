## Introduction

AMS-I.A., under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a small-scale methodology titled "Electricity generation by the user." It is designed to facilitate renewable electricity generation by individual households/users or groups of households/users, focusing primarily on sectoral scope 01. 

This methodology is crucial for projects that aim to displace more GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications by introducing renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaic, hydro, wind, and renewable biomass that supply electricity to individual households/users or groups of households/users. 

## Need and Use for the AMS-I.A Policy

The need for AMS-I.A. arises from the imperative to mitigate the environmental impacts of electricity generation using non-renewable, GHG-intensive electricity applications. The methodology is crucial for projects aiming to produce electricity using renewable energy technologies, thereby mitigating GHG emissions and contributing to environmental sustainability.  

AMS-I.A. is essential for projects that involve renewable electricity generation by individual households/users or groups of households/users, promoting the utilization of clean and sustainable energy sources and reducing reliance on non-renewable, GHG-intensive electricity applications. The methodology enables projects to displace more GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the mitigation of climate change impacts. By promoting renewable electricity generation by the user, AMS-I.A. contributes to enhancing energy security and reducing dependence on non-renewable electricity applications, fostering resilience and sustainability in energy systems. 

## Objective and Scope

The primary objective of AMS-I.A. is to provide a structured and standardized approach for small-scale renewable electricity generation projects by the user. It aims to facilitate the displacement of GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications by enabling the production of electricity using various renewable energy technologies. 

The scope of this methodology includes renewable electricity generation units like solar photovoltaic, hydro, wind, and renewable biomass that supply electricity to individual households/users or groups of households/users. It is applicable to various situations, including new installations (greenfield) or replacements of existing onsite fossil-fuel-fired generation, ensuring versatility and adaptability to different project needs and conditions.  

## Methodology Overview

AMS-I.A. is comprehensive and versatile, covering various renewable energy technologies and applicable to different types of project activities. It mandates stringent criteria to ensure genuine emissions reductions and the displacement of GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications. The methodology provides clear guidelines and conditions for the applicability based on project types, ensuring clarity and precision in its implementation.

## Typical Projects

Typical projects under AMS-I.A. involve renewable electricity generation by individual households/users or groups of households/users. These projects are pivotal in displacing more GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications, contributing significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of environmental sustainability. They can range from new installations of renewable electricity generation units to replacements of existing onsite fossil-fuel-fired generation, allowing for a broad spectrum of applications in different contexts and conditions. 

## Available Roles

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions. 

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration. 

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens. 

## Key Documents & Schemas

Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc. 

Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions. 

Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology. 

## Token (Carbon Emission Reduction)

Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2.
