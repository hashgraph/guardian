## Introduction

ACM0001, under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a large-scale consolidated methodology focusing on the flaring or utilization of landfill gas (LFG). This methodology is applicable to projects that involve the capture and destruction of methane emissions from landfill sites and the displacement of more GHG-intensive services through the use of captured landfill gas to produce energy or supply consumers. It is meticulously designed to address the pressing environmental concerns associated with landfill gas emissions, primarily focusing on the sectoral scopes 01 and 13. 

This methodology is centered around the capture of landfill gas (LFG) and its subsequent utilization or flaring, aiming to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions effectively. It is instrumental in the destruction of methane emissions and the displacement of more GHG-intensive services, contributing significantly to global efforts to combat climate change. 

ACM0001 is applicable to projects that involve the installation of new LFG capture systems or investments into existing ones, in both existing and new (Greenfield) Solid Waste Disposal Sites (SWDS). The methodology is versatile, allowing the captured LFG to be used in various ways, including generating electricity and heat, or supplying to consumers through different mediums like natural gas distribution networks, dedicated pipelines, or trucks. 

## Need and Use for the ACM0001 Policy

The need for ACM0001 arises from the urgent requirement to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of landfill gas emissions, which are a significant source of greenhouse gases, primarily methane. Methane is known for its high global warming potential, making the management and treatment of landfill gas crucial in the fight against climate change. 

ACM0001 is crucial for projects aiming to mitigate the environmental impact of landfill sites by capturing and destroying methane emissions and displacing more GHG-intensive services. It allows for the captured LFG to be used in several ways, such as generating electricity, producing heat, or supplying consumers through natural gas distribution networks, dedicated pipelines, or trucks. This methodology ensures the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to the transition towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly waste management and energy production practices.  

## Objective and Scope

The primary objective of ACM0001 is to provide a structured approach for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through the capture and utilization or flaring of landfill gas. This methodology is applicable to a variety of projects, including the installation of new LFG capture systems in existing or new solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) where no such systems existed prior, and investments into existing LFG capture systems to increase recovery rate or change the use of the captured LFG. 

## Methodology Overview

ACM0001 encompasses various scenarios and conditions, including the installation of new LFG capture systems and enhancements to existing ones, and it allows for the captured LFG to be used in multiple ways, ensuring versatility and adaptability to different project needs. The methodology mandates the demonstration of "additionality," confirming that the project would not have occurred without CDM support, and establishes stringent criteria to ensure genuine emissions reductions.

## Typical Projects

Typical projects under ACM0001 involve the capture of landfill gas and its utilization to produce energy or supply consumers, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the displacement of more GHG-intensive services. These projects can range from the installation of new LFG capture systems to enhancements to existing ones, allowing for a broad spectrum of applications in different contexts and conditions. 

## Available Roles

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions. 

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration. 

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.
