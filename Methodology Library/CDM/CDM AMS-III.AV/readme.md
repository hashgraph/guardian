## Introduction

AMS-III.AV presents an approach aimed at providing safe drinking water by adopting low greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting water purification systems. This methodology stands as a pivotal step towards displacing environmentally detrimental practices, specifically non-renewable biomass, or fossil fuel-based water boiling, with sustainable technologies for water treatment. By addressing the critical need for safe drinking water while concurrently reducing GHG emissions, AMS-III.AV emerges as a catalyst for fostering healthier and more sustainable communities worldwide. 

## Key Objectives and Scope

The primary objective of AMS-III.AV revolves around mitigating GHG emissions by replacing water boiling practices reliant on non-renewable biomass or fossil fuels with low-emission water purification systems. This methodology encompasses a diverse array of point-of-use (POU) or point-of-entry (POE) water treatment systems tailored for residential or institutional settings. Ranging from membrane filters to solar-powered ultraviolet (UV) disinfection devices and chemical disinfection methods like chlorination, these technologies constitute the core toolkit. Soil filtration schemes, including boreholes and wells with container disinfection, also fall within the scope of this methodology, fostering a comprehensive approach towards sustainable water treatment solutions. 

## Need and Use for the AMS-III.AV Policy

Access to safe drinking water stands as a fundamental human right, yet millions globally face challenges in securing this basic necessity. Unsafe water sources, often contaminated by pathogens, pollutants, and inadequate sanitation, pose severe health risks, leading to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 2 billion people globally consume water from sources contaminated with feces, emphasizing the urgent need for reliable and safe drinking water solutions. 

AMS-III.AV plays a role in addressing this global crisis by advocating for the adoption of low greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting water purification systems. Beyond the immediate goal of mitigating GHG emissions, this methodology aims to ensure the availability of safe drinking water, especially in regions lacking access to established public distribution networks. By facilitating the implementation of technologies that treat water at its point of use or entry, AMS-III.AV not only combats environmental challenges but also addresses crucial health concerns associated with contaminated water sources. 

Safe drinking water is an indispensable component of public health and well-being. The availability of clean and potable water significantly reduces the risk of waterborne diseases and contributes to the overall improvement of health outcomes. However, various regions face substantial hurdles in securing safe water access due to inadequate infrastructure, environmental degradation, and limited resources.

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp.  
Policy: 

## Available Roles 

- Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.   

- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.   

- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.  

## Important Documents & Schemas 

Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc. 

Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions. 

Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology. 

## Token (Carbon Emission Reduction)  
Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2.

## Step by Step
1. Log in as the Standard Registry and import the policy either by file or through IPFS timestamp by selecting the third button at the top right.
