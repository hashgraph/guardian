  "field21": "\"Purpose of the Project Activity: The purpose of the project activity is to generate clean electricity and contribute to achieving the requirements of the Green Economy Strategy of the country by harnessing renewable “Solar Energy” with the help of Solar PV technology.  Project Overview: The project activity is the first utility-scale grid-connected 100 MWac solar power plant/unit in the Republic of Uzbekistan. The project activity is a Greenfield project, meaning it is a new solar PV-based power generation plant installed at a site where no solar power plant was operating prior to the implementation of the project activity.  Implementation: The project activity has been implemented in the Region of Navoi, Karmana district by Eco Solutions LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC - Masdar, a global leader in renewable energy and sustainable urban development. Masdar has pioneered clean energy, sustainable real estate, and clean technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and around the world.  Impact: The electricity generated from the project activity is exported to the national grid of Uzbekistan, thereby displacing fossil fuel-dominant electricity from the Uzbekistan electricity distribution system. This reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere and contributes towards global efforts to reduce global warming and strengthen the country’s energy security and sustainability.  Project Boundary: In line with the applicable methodology GCCM001 v4, Para 12, “The spatial extent of the project boundary includes the project power plant and substation connected physically to the electricity system that the GCC project power plant is connected to the National Electricity Grid of Uzbekistan.”  Baseline Scenario: The most plausible baseline scenario for the project activity is that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would be generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources into the grid.  Expected Performance: The project activity is expected to generate an annual average of 272,274 MWh during the crediting period, leading to an estimated average reduction of 151,929 tCO2 annually. The total GHG emission reduction estimated over the chosen crediting period is 1,519,291 tCO2. The project activity was fully commissioned on 10/12/2021.\"",

  "field26": "\"The project activity involves the installation of a Solar PV-based electricity generation facility by Eco Solutions LLC. The total installed capacity of the project is 100 MWac, located in the Navoi Region, Republic of Uzbekistan.  The Project Activity is a new facility (Greenfield), and the electricity generated by the project is being exported to the national electricity grid. The project will therefore displace an equivalent amount of electricity that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuel-dominant electricity sources. In the pre-project scenario, the electricity delivered to the grid by the project would have otherwise been generated by fossil fuel-dominant grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.  The project results in replacing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), estimated to be approximately 151,929 tCO2e per year. The project activity aims to harness solar energy through the installation of a Solar PV project with a total installed capacity of 100 MWac.\"",
  "field27": "\"The monitoring plan is established for the grid-connected solar energy power project to continuously measure, monitor & periodically record the net electricity delivered to the grid. The monitoring plan describes the monitoring organization, parameters to be monitored, monitoring practices, quality assurance, quality control procedures, data storage and archiving.  The authority and responsibility for registration, monitoring, measurement, reporting and reviewing of the data rests with the project participants. The following structure works for data monitoring, collection, data archiving and calibration of equipment for this project activity. The team comprises of the following members: Organizational Structure for Monitoring Responsibilities of Head- Projects: Tracking and reviewing the overall functioning and maintenance of the project activity from Head (Operations). Head (Operations) reports Head (Projects). Responsibilities of Head- Operations: Overall functioning of the project activity and Coordinating with the O & M Team for the proper functioning of Project activity. He reports to Head (Projects). Responsibilities of O & M Team: O & M team is responsible for Operations and Maintenance related issues, they are also responsible for day-to-day data collection and monitoring, ensures completeness and reliability of data (calibration of equipment). The Site In-charge is responsible for carrying out internal auditing and QA/QC. All the values from generation record are checked with XYZ and invoices for consistency. In case there are any nonconformances identified. The Site In-charge investigates the error and revises the record to correct it. In any case where values have the slightest variation in different records the most conservative value is taken in the project monitoring report. Data collection and archiving Export & Import readings from main & check meters are collected under the supervision of an authorized representative of XYZ (the purchaser/ Off - taker). The net electricity supplied to the grid are calculated based on export & import meter readings. Export and Import data is recorded and stored on electronic &/or paper. The records are checked periodically by the Head (Operations) and discussed thoroughly with the O & M Team. The period of storage of the monitored data is 2 years after the end of crediting period or till the last issuance of ACCs for the project activity whichever occurs later. Both the main and check meters of the project are found within the acceptable limits of accuracy functioning properly. Mismatch in Monitoring Period and the Billing Period In case the dates of a particular monitoring period do not match with the dates of the billing period, the net electricity exported to the grid is calculated from: A= Difference of number of days which are not matching of billing period and monitoring period. B= Number of days of the billing period/month which was not matched with the monitoring period. C= Net electricity supplied to the grid for that given billing period/month.  The calculated value after apportioning would be used for calculation of emission reductions during that period. Emergency preparedness: The project activity does not result in any unidentified activity that can result in substantial emissions from the project activity. No need for emergency preparedness in data monitoring is visualized. In the unlikely event of failure of both Main meter & Check meter installed at sub-station, where both the faulty meters are required to repair or replace simultaneously, the export & import readings from Main & Check Meters installed at the inter-connection point at the project site are used for monitoring of net electricity exported to the grid. Personnel Training: To ensure proper functioning of the project activity and proper monitoring of emission reductions, the staff is trained. The plant helpers are trained in equipment operation, data recording, reports writing, operations and maintenance, and emergency procedures in compliance with the monitoring plan.\"",
