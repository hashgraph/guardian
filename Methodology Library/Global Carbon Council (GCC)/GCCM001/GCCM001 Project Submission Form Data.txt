Project Overview: The project activity is the first utility-scale grid-connected 100 MWac solar power plant/unit in the Republic of Uzbekistan. The project activity is a Greenfield project, meaning it is a new solar PV-based power generation plant installed at a site where no solar power plant was operating prior to the implementation of the project activity.  Implementation: The project activity has been implemented in the Region of Navoi, Karmana district by Eco Solutions LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC - Masdar, a global leader in renewable energy and sustainable urban development. Masdar has pioneered clean energy, sustainable real estate, and clean technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and around the world.  Impact: The electricity generated from the project activity is exported to the national grid of Uzbekistan, thereby displacing fossil fuel-dominant electricity from the Uzbekistan electricity distribution system. This reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere and contributes towards global efforts to reduce global warming and strengthen the country’s energy security and sustainability.  Project Boundary: In line with the applicable methodology GCCM001 v4, Para 12, “The spatial extent of the project boundary includes the project power plant and substation connected physically to the electricity system that the GCC project power plant is connected to the National Electricity Grid of Uzbekistan.”  Baseline Scenario: The most plausible baseline scenario for the project activity is that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would be generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources into the grid.  Expected Performance: The project activity is expected to generate an annual average of 272,274 MWh during the crediting period, leading to an estimated average reduction of 151,929 tCO2 annually. The total GHG emission reduction estimated over the chosen crediting period is 1,519,291 tCO2. The project activity was fully commissioned on 10/12/2021.",

The total installed capacity of the project is 100 MWac, located in the Navoi Region, Republic of Uzbekistan.  The Project Activity is a new facility (Greenfield), and the electricity generated by the project is being exported to the national electricity grid. The project will therefore displace an equivalent amount of electricity that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuel-dominant electricity sources. In the pre-project scenario, the electricity delivered to the grid by the project would have otherwise been generated by fossil fuel-dominant grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.  The project results in replacing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), estimated to be approximately 151,929 tCO2e per year.

The project activity involves setting up solar panels to harness solar energy to produce electricity and supply it to the grid. In the absence of the project activity, the equivalent amount of power would have been generated by the Uzbek grid-connected fossil fuel-fired power plants or through the addition of a new grid-connected power plant, which is primarily fed by fossil fuel-fired plants according to the current scenario of the Uzbek energy profile of the electricity grid.  During the implementation of the project activity, the relevant national and/or sectoral policies, regulations, and circumstances are considered:  Implementation of solar energy-based power projects for electricity generation is not mandatory under any law in Uzbekistan; the project activity is a voluntary action. Article 3 of The Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan 'On the Use of Renewable Energy Sources' No. 539 dated 21 May 2019 Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan 'On the Strategy of Further Development and Reform of the Electric Power Industry of the Republic of Uzbekistan' PP4249 dated 27 March 2019 Article 1 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan 'On Public–Private Partnership' No. 539 dated 15 May 2019 Law 'On Normative Acts' Uzbekistan is focusing on goals to develop renewable energy and increasing its share in the overall energy mix. There is no legal and regulatory requirement that mandates the production of energy by the chosen technology in the Republic of Uzbekistan. There are no national or local laws or regulations that mandate this investment to be undertaken, i.e., setting up solar power projects. The setting up of solar energy projects is a voluntary activity.  The grid emission factor for the Republic of Uzbekistan, from the International Financial Institutions (IFI) database, 2021, is the latest available data at the time of PSF submission to GCC, and thus, it is considered for emission factor calculation.",

    "field24": "As per the GCC approved Methodology GCCM001, version 4.0:  Baseline emissions include only CO2 emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel-fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The methodology assumes that all project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated by existing grid-connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants. The baseline emissions are to be calculated as follows:  BEY = EG_PJ,Y × EF_grid,Y  where:  BEY = Baseline emissions for the year Y EG_PJ,Y = Electricity generated by the project in year Y EF_grid,Y = Emission factor of the grid in year Y Data available on the emission factor for Uzbekistan is from the year 2013 and is obsolete. There is no latest country-level data available for Uzbekistan. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 cannot be considered for the emission factor. Hence, the emission factor for the project activity is considered from the IFI database.  Where:  EG_PJ,Y = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year Y (MWh/yr) EG_PJ,Y = 272,274 MWh Baseline emission factor (EFY):  The baseline emission factor is considered as per option 4 provided under Para 24 of the GCCM001, i.e., “Latest IFI combined margin emission factors published on the UNFCCC website.”  Therefore:  EFY = EF_grid,Y = 0.5580 tCO2/MWh BEY = 272,274 × 0.5580 = 151,929 tCO2 (Detailed calculation is provided under the Emission Reduction Calculation sheet) Project Emission:  For most renewable energy project activities, project emissions are equal to zero. However, CO2 emissions from on-site consumption of electricity by the project activity shall be calculated using the latest version of the CDM methodological tool “Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation.” This project is a renewable Solar PV based power generation project. The import of electricity has already been deducted in the Joint Meter Reading (JMR) document as per the practice followed in the Host Country. Additionally, there is a small on-site consumption of fossil fuel for a diesel generator (DG) set for auxiliary consumption in emergency conditions when power is not available from the grid/solar. The DG is designed to work for emergency shutdown as backup auxiliary power generation.  Due to the Test Run Procedure, diesel consumption from January 2022 to June 2022 was 350 liters, i.e., a maximum of 700 liters per year. This diesel consumption is equivalent to 2 tCO2 of emission. Since this is a very small and negligible amount, it is considered insignificant and hence as zero for calculation in project emissions.  Diesel Consumption in liters: 700 Emission Factor of Diesel in tCO2/liter: 0.002568 (Based on IPCC 2006 default values) Emission due to diesel consumption: 1.7976 tCO2. It is infinitesimal in comparison to baseline emissions; therefore, it is considered as zero. The Net electricity delivered to the grid is considered from the JMR. Hence, PEY = 0  Leakage Emissions:  No leakage emissions are anticipated under this methodology. Hence, LEY = 0  Emission Reductions:  ERy = BEY − PEY − LEY = 151,929 − 0 − 0 = 151,929 tCO2 Total GHG emission reduction for 10 years would be:  Total GHG = ERy × 10 years = 151,929 × 10 = 1,519,291 tCO2",
