# UNFCCC CDM Tool 30: Calculation of the Fraction of Non-Renewable Biomass (Version 04.0)

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 30** provides a methodology for determining the fraction of woody biomass that is considered non-renewable (fNRB) within CDM project activities. This tool is pivotal for projects displacing non-renewable biomass with renewable energy sources, ensuring accurate calculation of baseline emissions and enhancing the credibility of emission reductions claimed.

## Purpose and Scope

- Designed to guide the calculation of fNRB for projects or programmes of activities that utilize biomass, aiming to displace non-renewable biomass usage.
- Applicable to various methodologies within the CDM framework, supporting accurate and conservative emission reduction estimations.

## Key Features

- **Step-wise Procedure:** Outlines a detailed method for estimating total consumption of woody biomass and distinguishing between renewable and non-renewable fractions.
- **Flexibility in Application:** Can be used by DNAs for region- or country-specific default values, or by project participants for project-specific calculations.

## Application Process

1. **Determine Applicable Area:** Identify the source area for woody biomass used in the project.
2. **Calculate fNRB:** Follow the tool's methodology to calculate the non-renewable fraction, using either default values or project-specific data.
3. **Justify and Document:** Provide justification for the chosen methodology and document the process in CDM project design documents.

## Importance in CDM Projects

Tool 30 is essential for:
- Ensuring the sustainability and environmental integrity of biomass-based CDM projects.
- Providing a standardized approach to accounting for the non-renewable fraction of biomass, crucial for accurate emission reduction calculations.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 30** enhances the accuracy and transparency of calculating non-renewable biomass fractions, supporting the development of sustainable, biomass-related CDM projects.
