# UNFCCC CDM Tool 12: Methodological Tool for Project and Leakage Emissions from Transportation of Freight (Version 01.1.0)

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 12** offers methodologies for estimating CO2 emissions associated with the transportation of freight, crucial for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project activities where transportation is a significant component but not the main activity. It facilitates the calculation of direct emissions from freight transportation, enabling projects to accurately account for their carbon footprint and identify potential emission reductions.

## Purpose and Scope

This tool is designed to support the calculation of:
- **Project Emissions:** Emissions directly associated with the transportation of freight within CDM projects.
- **Leakage Emissions:** Emissions that occur outside the project boundary as a result of project implementation.

## Key Features

- **Dual Calculation Options:** Offers methodologies based on actual fuel consumption monitoring or conservative default values for emissions estimation.
- **Inclusion of Default Emission Factors:** Provides default emission factors for rail freight transportation, aiding in the absence of specific data.
- **Exclusion of CH4 and N2O:** Simplifies calculations by focusing on CO2 emissions, excluding methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) for practicality.

## Application Process

1. **Determine the Mode of Transportation:** Identify the transportation methods used for freight within the project scope.
2. **Select Calculation Method:** Choose between monitoring fuel consumption directly or applying default emission factors.
3. **Calculate Emissions:** Use the selected method to estimate project and leakage CO2 emissions from freight transportation.
4. **Documentation and Reporting:** Thoroughly document the calculation process and results for inclusion in CDM project documentation.

## Importance in CDM Projects

Tool 12 is essential for accurately assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of freight transportation in CDM projects. By providing a standardized approach to calculating transportation emissions, it ensures that projects can effectively contribute to emission reduction targets and sustainable development goals.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 12** is an invaluable resource for project developers involved in freight transportation within the CDM framework. It streamlines the process of estimating transportation-related CO2 emissions, ensuring that projects achieve credible and measurable emission reductions.
