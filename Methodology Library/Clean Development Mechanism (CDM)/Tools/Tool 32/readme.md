# UNFCCC CDM Tool 32: Positive Lists of Technologies (Version 04.0)

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 32** establishes positive lists of technologies that automatically confer additionality for CDM project activities and programmes. This simplifies the process for projects applying these technologies, aiding in demonstrating their contribution to GHG emission reductions.

## Purpose and Scope

Aimed at streamlining additionality demonstration for certain technologies, this tool covers sectors like waste handling, disposal, and renewable energy among others, facilitating their acceptance within the CDM framework.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Additionality:** Technologies listed automatically meet the additionality requirement.
- **Diverse Sectors:** Includes waste management, renewable energy, and technologies used by households, communities, and SMEs.

## Application Process

1. **Identify Relevant Technology:** Match project technology with the positive list.
2. **Ensure Compliance:** Verify that project activities meet the specific conditions for automatic additionality.
3. **Documentation:** Integrate this determination into project documentation for CDM application.

## Importance in CDM Projects

Crucial for expediting the validation of projects employing listed technologies, promoting sustainable development through predefined, environmentally beneficial technologies.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 32** significantly aids project developers by pre-identifying technologies that contribute to emission reductions, streamlining the CDM project approval process.
