# UNFCCC CDM Tool 21: Demonstration of Additionality of Small-Scale Project Activities (Version 13.1)

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 21** provides a comprehensive framework for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of small-scale project activities within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). This methodological tool is crucial for ensuring that small-scale projects contribute to genuine, measurable greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.

## Purpose and Scope

Tool 21 is aimed at:
- Offering a simplified approach for small-scale projects to demonstrate additionality.
- Applicable to a broad spectrum of project types, ensuring inclusivity within the CDM.

## Key Features

- **General Framework for Additionality:** Simplifies the demonstration of additionality for small-scale projects.
- **Flexibility in Application:** Allows for alternative methods to demonstrate additionality, providing versatility.

## Application Process

1. **Assess Project Eligibility:** Determine if the project qualifies as small-scale.
2. **Demonstrate Additionality:** Utilize the tool to demonstrate that the project's GHG reductions are additional.
3. **Documentation and Reporting:** Compile and submit documentation as per CDM requirements.

## Importance in CDM Projects

This tool is essential for facilitating the participation of small-scale projects in the CDM, promoting sustainable development and contributing to global emission reduction efforts.

## Conclusion

**UNFCCC CDM Tool 21** is vital for small-scale project participants, offering a streamlined path to demonstrate additionality and participate effectively in the CDM framework.
