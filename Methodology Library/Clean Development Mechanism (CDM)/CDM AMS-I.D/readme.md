## Introduction

The AMS-I.D Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation methodology presents a framework for the construction, operation, retrofit, rehabilitation, replacement, or capacity addition of power plants harnessing renewable energy sources to supply electricity to the grid. In the face of growing environmental concerns, this methodology serves as a vital instrument in curbing greenhouse gas emissions by displacing electricity that would otherwise be generated through more GHG-intensive means. With a focus on a diverse range of renewable sources such as photovoltaic, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal, and renewable biomass, the AMS-I.D methodology encapsulates projects contributing to sustainable and clean energy practices, ensuring a substantial impact on reducing the carbon footprint of electricity generation.

The significance of AMS-I.D extends beyond individual power plants, emphasizing the collective effort to transition towards a low-carbon energy landscape. By providing a quantitative approach applicable to various project scenarios, including the incorporation of new technologies and the retrofitting of existing facilities, it reinforces the commitment to renewable energy adoption. With considerations for eligibility criteria, baseline scenarios, and important parameters, AMS-I.D Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation can be used as a tool to quantify emission reductions.

## Scope

This methodology encompasses the construction, operation, retrofit, rehabilitation, replacement, or capacity addition of power plants utilizing renewable energy sources to supply electricity to the grid. The primary focus is on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of electricity that would otherwise be provided to the grid by more GHG-intensive means.

## Applicability

This methodology is applicable to project activities that:

- Install a Greenfield plant.
- Involve a capacity addition in existing plant(s).
- Involve retrofit, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing plant(s).
- Involve hydro power plants with reservoirs meeting specific conditions.
  
## Eligibility Conditions

- Hydro power plants with specific reservoir conditions.
- New units with both renewable and non-renewable components, where the eligibility limit applies only to the renewable component.
- Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible.
- Capacity addition of renewable energy generation units at existing facilities should have added capacity lower than 15 MW and be physically distinct from existing units.
- Landfill gas, waste gas, wastewater treatment, and agro-industries projects have specific eligibility conditions.

## Project Boundary

The spatial extent of the project boundary includes the project power plant and all power plants physically connected to the electricity system that the project power plant is connected to.

## Baseline Scenarios

For Greenfield power plants, the baseline scenario assumes the electricity delivered to the grid would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources into the grid.

For retrofit, rehabilitation, or replacement, the baseline scenario is the continuing operation of the existing plant until the time it would likely be retrofitted, rehabilitated, or replaced.

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp. 
 
## Available Roles

- Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.  
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.  
- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens. 

## Important Documents and Schemas

Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc. 

Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions. 

Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.   

## Token (Carbon Emission Reduction)

Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2. 

### Step By Step
