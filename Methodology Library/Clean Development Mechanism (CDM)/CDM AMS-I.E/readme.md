## Introduction

This policy focuses on the AMS-I.E methodology, "Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User." The methodology is designed to facilitate the generation of thermal energy by introducing renewable energy technologies for end-users, thereby displacing the use of non-renewable biomass. These technologies include, but are not limited to, cookstoves using renewable biomass, biogas stoves, bio-ethanol stoves, and electric cookstoves powered by renewable energy sources. By providing clear guidelines for monitoring parameters and quantifying emission reductions, AMS-I.E aims to ensure reliable data and effective implementation of renewable energy solutions in households, communities, and institutions.

## Need and Use

The AMS-I.E methodology can be utilized by project developers aiming to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through renewable energy technologies in thermal applications. This methodology supports the displacement of more GHG-intensive, non-renewable biomass-fueled applications by introducing renewable energy technologies. Key applications include cookstoves using renewable biomass, biogas stoves, bio-ethanol stoves, and electric cookstoves powered by renewable energy systems.

AMS-I.E encompasses activities that replace the use of non-renewable biomass with renewable energy technologies in households, communities, and institutions such as schools, prisons, and hospitals. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for electric cookstoves to ensure a high percentage of renewable energy use and limits the use of backup diesel generators.

By adhering to the AMS-I.E methodology, project developers can achieve significant emission reductions, promote the use of renewable energy, and contribute to sustainable development. This methodology also includes provisions to prevent double counting of emission reductions and ensures the safety and compliance of bio-ethanol cookstoves with relevant standards.

## Standard Stove Performance Testing

Monitoring and evaluating improved cookstove performance is crucial for developing effective cookstove programs. There are three main types of stove performance tests: Water Boiling Test (WBT), Controlled Cooking Test (CCT), and Kitchen Performance Test (KPT).

**Water Boiling Test (WBT)**: WBT is a laboratory test that evaluates stove performance during a controlled task (boiling and simmering water). It is simple, quick, and cost-effective but does not accurately reflect real cooking conditions. WBT is conducted by trained technicians in a controlled environment, revealing technical performance rather than actual household use.

**Controlled Cooking Test (CCT)**: CCT measures stove performance when a local meal is prepared, either in a lab or field setting. It assesses performance under ideal conditions, simulating local practices. However, CCT still doesn't capture the full range of real-world variables like fuel variability and operator behavior differences.

**Kitchen Performance Test (KPT)**: KPT is the primary field test used to evaluate stove performance in real-world settings, conducted in users' homes to assess actual impacts on household fuel consumption. KPTs provide the most accurate understanding of stove performance but are labor-intensive and intrusive, with results influenced by the less controlled environment.

Overall, improved cookstove performance testing involves balancing logistical complexities and realistic reflection of outcomes. While each test type has strengths and weaknesses, a combination of laboratory and field testing is recommended for comprehensive evaluation. This approach ensures that performance testing accounts for local food preparation and real-world usage, enhancing the reliability of results.

## Different Cookstove Methodologies: Pros and Cons

**VMR0006**: VMR0006 provides a cost-effective solution by utilizing default values and less frequent monitoring, which helps reduce project costs while maintaining reliable data. However, this approach may not capture real-time variations in fuel use and emissions as precisely as continuous monitoring methods.

**Gold Standard Metered Methodology**: The Gold Standard Metered Methodology offers robust monitoring of stove usage and fuel consumption, ensuring high data accuracy and transparency. However, it involves higher costs due to the need for continuous monitoring equipment and may require more technical expertise to implement.

**Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) AMS-II.G**: The CDM AMS-II.G methodology is well-established and widely recognized, using conservative estimates to ensure credibility. However, it can be complex and costly to implement due to rigorous data requirements and may not be as flexible as other methodologies in adapting to local conditions.

## Overview of Cookstove Methodologies

Various methodologies are used to quantify emissions reductions in cookstove projects, each with its own approach to monitoring and verification. These methodologies include cross-sectional surveys, kitchen performance tests (KPTs), and continuous monitoring systems (CMS). Cross-sectional surveys and KPTs are commonly used to gather data on stove adoption, usage, and fuel consumption, while CMS provides real-time data but at a higher cost. The methodologies also address issues such as stove stacking, rebound effects, and leakage to ensure accurate emissions reductions. More details on these methodologies can be found on the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project's website.

## Policy Workflow

## Policy Import

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp.

## Available Roles

**Project Participant** - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.

**Verification and Validation Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.

**Registry (UNFCCC)** - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.
