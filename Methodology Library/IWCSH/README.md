# Improved-Waste-Collection-Segregation-and-Handling-policy

## Introduction:
In most developing countries, waste handling is a menace and most if not all ends up in a landfills, which in turn poses a greater risk to sorrounding communities and is responsible for  production of methane gas.
With proper waste segregation and handling, lots of waste that could otherwise end up in a landfill, could be reused, recycled or composted thereby overstretching landfills in developing countries.
In many developing countries  urban areas waste collection services are inadequate or non-existent, Lack of proper infrastructure, equipment, and funding for waste collection services leads to the accumulation of waste in public spaces and illegal dumping.
