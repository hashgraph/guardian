## Guardian Policy for Improved Cookstoves

**Introduction**

Currently, there are many different types of cookstoves and several Standards Bodies, each with their own Standard that must be followed in order to prove the quality of a given GHG emission reduction claim. This process is time and labor intensive, creating barriers to those willing to enter the market. Digitization of this manual, paper driven process is a necessary step to scaling at the speed required for climate change.

The Value of Digitizing the Methodology:

1. Creates trust via
- Traceability and transparency of data
- Digital quality assurance
- Immutability of data
- Transparency of Verifier credentials and approval data

2. Reduces barriers to entry
- Accessible and standardized policies and processes inform and encourage suppliers to bring their projects to market
- Decentralized project management reduces dependency on Standards Bodies and reduces time to market.

3. Contributes to Climate Goals
- Achieves higher confidence carbon project outcomes, and scales the finance and rollout of carbon projects at the speed required by the climate emergency

This first of its kind Hedera Guardian Improved Cookstove Policy (ICP) was designed per the [Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/An+ontology+for+anthropogenic+impact+accounting). To this end, the Guardian Policy does not adhere to a specific Standard or approved methodology for carbon offset quantification, rather it abstracts concepts from the most commonly used standards and methodologies, categorizes them, models their relationships, and then instantiates them in the form of this digitally native Guardian Policy and its associated Guardian Schema. This policy issues a non-fungible Improved Cookstove Carbon Credit (ICCC) Token.

**Scope and Applicability**

Scope: Quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from improved biomass cookstoves developed by the Nova Institute and Tolam Earth, Inc.

Applicability: Applicable to activities reducing GHG emissions from cookstoves through switching to more energy efficient stoves.

Token: Non-Fungible

Type: Carbon Offset

Standard: Multiple

Methodology: Multiple

Required Documents: Project Design Document (PDD), PDD Validation Report, Monitoring Report, Monitoring Report Verification, Double Counting Certification, VVB Certification and Conflict of Interest Statement. See 'Preconditions' below for more detail.

NFT Owner: The agent fulfilling the 'Project Developer' role.

**Preconditions**

1. Standard Registry account on a Guardian instance to import the policy and its subpolicies. See [Guardian documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/policy-creation-using-the-guardian-apis/prerequesite-steps) for steps to create an account and import a policy.
2. User accounts within the Guardian to fill the roles defined in the policy and its subpolicies.
3. Required Project Documentation posted to traceable, immutable source which can be accessed by the Tolam Earth Marketplace.
4. To fulfil the Project Developer role (see 'Roles' below for details), an agent must obtain an HGICP Project Developer License (HGICP-L-PD) from the ICP Agent Application Subpolicy.
5. To fulfil the PDD Validator role, an agent must obtain an HGICP PDD Validator License (HGICP-L-PV) from the ICP Agent Application Subpolicy.
6. To fulfil the MR Verifier role, an agent must obtain an HGICP MR Verifier License (HGICP-L-MV) form the ICP Agent Application Subpolicy.
7. In addition to an HGICP-L-PD, a Project Developer will need to obtain an HGICP PDD Validation Certificate (HGICP-VCERT-PDD, issued by the ICP PDD Validation Subpolicy) to complete the project registration step of the main policy. To apply for an ICCC issuance, a Project Developer will furthermore need to obtain an HGICP MR Verification Certificate (HGICP-VCERT-MR, issued by the ICP MR Verification Subpolicy).

**Glossary**

Claim: The end result of execution of a project, often expressed per unit time, which quantifies the impact of the initiative.

Guardian: The Guardian is a modular open-source solution that includes best-in-class identity management and Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) libraries. At the heart of the Guardian solution is a sophisticated Policy Workflow Engine (PWE) that enables applications to offer a requirements-based tokenization implementation.

Guardian Policy: Defines activities, rules, and interactions between activities on and across all levels of the activity hierarchy, that are performed in order to achieve the outcome of an auditable, transparent claim of climate impact.

Guardian Schema: Describes the structure and definition of data fields required within an activity, sub-activity, or sub-sub-activity. Essentially, the schema defines the data fields that must be supplied for each activity and the characteristics of those fields.

Methodology: As part of a Standard, Methodologies define the rules for calculating emissions increase, footprint, reductions and/or removals.

Monitoring Report: Document that describes and justifies any changes to the Project Design Document, based upon what happened during execution of a project. Also includes any data and/or calculations made during the time period covered by the document. A single project can have multiple Monitoring Reports associated with it, and each Monitoring Report is associated with a Claim.

Project Design Document: Documentation of plans for an activity to be executed following the prescriptions of the Standard in a concrete context for generation of assets.

Project Documentation: Any documentation required by the Guardian Schema. This may include Monitoring Reports, Project Design Documents, Verifier Credentials, etc.

Project Listing Application: Process during which a Project Developer expresses their intent to develop a (cookstove) project towards a specific Registry, and the Registry then acknowledges that intent by assigning a project code to the project and listing it in the Registry’s public database of projects.

Project Registration: When Project Design Documents are approved by a Registry.

Standard: Set of project design, monitoring, and reporting criteria against which activities’ impacts can be certified or verified, e.g. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions, or social benefits.

Standards Body: Organization which defines the standard and approves project design, monitoring, and reporting criteria within it.
