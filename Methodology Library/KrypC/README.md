# KrypC Carbon Core Policy – Global Carbon Council

### KrypC Guardian Policy Template Methodologies

KrypC has developed a custom policy for Renewable Energy Generation projects using Global Carbon Council (GCC) Methodology. The policy facilitates the project owners of eligible Green House Gas (GHG) reduction projects to calculate, monitor the emission reductions of their projects and to develop the project submission in accordance with the methodologies.

In this document will take you through the process of Guardian Policy Integration for any product team. 

KrypC Carbon Core platform is using the GCCM0001 methodology for Renewable Energy Generation Projects Supplying Electricity to Grid or Captive Consumers to create the policy for tokenization of the carbon credit via Hedera Hash graph technology.

The power generated from the Renewable sources can be either directly sold to the grid or used for captive consumption or can be stored in a Battery storage solution (BESS) attached to renewable energy generation plant and then delivered to the grid or used for captive consumption.

### The different actors within KrypC policies

Below Four different types of users involved in Carbon Core platform.

•	Admin - Onboard system users and project owner

•	CC Consultant - Manages Project Documentation outside of the Guardian and transcribes into the Guardian.

•	Auditor - Reviews monitoring reports and approve/reject.

•	Project Owner – A person who is considered as the owner of the offsets and has complete access to it.


### Emission Calculation using Guardian Middleware API 

The policy is based on following baseline and monitoring methodologies of CDM/GCC;

•	ACM0002: Grid connected electricity generation from renewable sources; and

•	AMS-I-D: Grid connected renewable electricity generation.

•	AMS I F: Renewable energy generation for Captive use and Mini grid

The policy also refers to the latest approved versions of the following tools and guidelines of CDM/GCC;

•	Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system.

•	Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation.

•	Tool for Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality.


**Baseline emissions**

This includes only CO2 emissions from electricity generation in power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The policy refers to the methodology that assumes that all project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated by existing grid connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants. The baseline emissions are to be calculated as follows:

**BEy = EG BL,y × EFCO2,y**

**EFCO2,y = EF grid,CM,y**

**Project Emissions** 

Under this policy we assume that most renewable energy project activities, project emissions are equal to zero.

**PEy = 0**

**Leakage Emissions**

As per methodology used in this policy, no leakage emissions are anticipated

**LEy = 0**

**Estimation of emission reductions**

As per policy referred from section 12 of GCCM001 V3.0, the formula to calculate the emission reductions is followed.

**ERY=BEY-PEY-LEY**

**Guardian Policy Workflow Process**

![policy_workflow](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/assets/134472833/758c8fcc-c6c8-4995-baca-892a9c0d8a6d)

Admin gets the Organization/Project owners information based on offline communication according to due diligence which is part of onboarding process. Then admin adds them to the system.

**Adding Project details & Predictive data**

Consultant creates a project based on offline communication with Project Owners/Organizations and adds ex ante data. A wallet was created for project owners at the time of the first project creation.

![grid1](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/assets/134472833/8e2c0fa8-8ac5-4b38-8cf8-f88af3f634cd)

**Onboarding Meters, Submission & Verification of MRV data**

Consultants need to add devices, set the configuration and share it to Project Owners. They install it in devices which then send the MRV data to the system.

![grid2](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/assets/134472833/46161b0f-34bb-4d74-b987-5606afd2c778)

**Verification of Emission Reduction, Issuance of certificate & Minting Carbon Credits**

Consultant will prepare monitoring report and Emission values are calculated using the data captured from meter. Then he submits the monitoring report to the Auditor for approval.
Auditors issue the certificate on approval. Then the Consultant uploads the issued certificate, then tokens minted and transferred to project owner’s wallet.

### Policy Versioning

KrypC's policies will continue to evolve based on our ongoing requirements, we will do our best to update them within this repository, however, please reference our primary guardian policies repository for all up-to-date versions.

### KrypC’s Carbon Core Process

KrypC Carbon Core platform provides solutions for all parties simplifying the entire process making Carbon trading market safe, reliable, efficient, convenient, open and inclusive. It acts as ledger for creating the trust chain for the verified carbon units and verified emission reductions created. The platform also helps in verifying and minting carbon offset tokens and will lend its credibility towards 'high-quality' credits, attracting higher prices and allowing more funding to projects.
KrypC Carbon Core Platform tokenizes the carbon credits via Hedera Hash graph technology. This will be following steps;

• Create specific architecture and libraries for the Project listing process and documentation for various registries.

• Create MRVs, Architecture, and Libraries for carbon project listing processes and documentation on Hedera.

• Tokenize and mint tons of carbon offsets (tC02e).

• Complete the build with KrypC’s carbon solution platform as a ledger for creating the trust chain for the VCUs/VERs created by any stakeholder/partner.

• Recognizes different VERs/VCUs of by virtue of running a ‘pricing matrix’ of different ‘series of tokenized VERs/VCUs with the aim of having strong liquidity.

• Link to KrypC's Carbon solution for a full end-to-end platform for tokenized VCUs/VERs.

### Technical Architecture

Project creation and other activities happened through Carbon Core UI which then hits the related API services. Client and Admin/Consultant communication is though Jira. Once the policy is created guardian API will be called. Documents stored in IPFS. All the actions are saved in the database.
