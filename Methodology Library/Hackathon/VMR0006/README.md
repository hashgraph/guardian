### Introduction

The VCS Methodology VMR0006 provides a structured framework for quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions resulting from energy efficiency enhancements and fuel switch initiatives in thermal applications. With a focus on sustainability and resource conservation, VMR0006 aims to promote environmentally friendly practices in biomass and fossil fuel consumption.

### Need and use for the VMR0006 policy

VMR0006 addresses a critical need in mitigating environmental challenges associated with energy consumption in thermal applications, particularly the use of non-renewable biomass and fossil fuels. By providing a structured framework for implementing energy efficiency measures and fuel switch activities, VMR0006 aims to promote sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through its guidelines and procedures, VMR0006 facilitates the adoption of renewable biomass and enhances energy efficiency, contributing to climate change mitigation and resource conservation efforts. Furthermore, VMR0006 promotes transparent reporting and verification processes, ensuring accountability and fostering sustainable development practices. In essence, VMR0006 plays a pivotal role in advancing environmental sustainability and building resilient communities equipped to address the impacts of climate change.

### Workflow 

![Screenshot from 2024-04-03 23-25-03](https://github.com/Ni8crawler18/VMR0006-DLT/assets/149990456/c6c9baa8-8c52-4558-8246-032895b391e0)

The project proponent initiates the process by creating a project design document (VMR0006) for Verra, which includes details such as project description, additionality demonstration, baseline scenario, and estimated emission reductions. Verra and the Validation/Verification Body (VVB) review the project design document. Once approved, Emission reduction credits (ERC) are issued by Verra. The project is then added to the registry, and the project activities are monitored as per the VMR0006 guidelines. The monitored parameters are documented in a monitoring report, which is reviewed by the VVB. After successful review, the project is added to the project pipeline for further processing.

### Policy guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can be imported via Github (.policy file) 

### Available roles

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the energy efficiency or fuel switch project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VMR0006 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities, such as device distribution, biomass consumption, and emission reductions achieved. Upon successful validation and verification, the project proponent receives Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) as an incentive for their emission reductions.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VMR0006 guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration and credit issuance.

3. **Registry (Verra)** â€“ Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports. This process ensures that energy efficiency and fuel switch projects meet the VMR0006 methodology requirements before Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) are issued. Verra also oversees the issuance of ERCs to approved projects.

### Token issued

Emission Reduction Credit (ERC), each equivalent to (1) tonne of CO2 saved by sustainable thermal applications.
