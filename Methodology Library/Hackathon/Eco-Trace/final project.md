# Eco-Trace üåøüåé

## Inspiration üí°
Eco-Trace was inspired by the growing awareness and demand for sustainable products among consumers. With increasing concerns about environmental impact and ethical sourcing, there's a need for transparent systems that allow consumers to make informed choices about the products they purchase. Leveraging blockchain technology provided by Hedera Guardian, Eco-Trace aims to revolutionize supply chain transparency and enable consumers to trace the sustainability footprint of products with ease.

## What it does ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Eco-Trace is a decentralized application (DApp) that empowers consumers to trace the sustainability footprint of products. By leveraging the robust features of Hedera Guardian and Docker for containerization, Eco-Trace provides an immutable and transparent ledger for tracking the journey of products from their source to the consumer's hands. Through the Eco-Trace DApp, users can enter product details such as brand name and date of manufacture to retrieve comprehensive sustainability information in real-time. This transparency fosters trust between consumers and producers, driving the demand for more sustainable and ethical products.

## How we built it üèóÔ∏è
Eco-Trace was built using cutting-edge blockchain technology provided by Hedera Guardian and containerization technology like Docker. The development team utilized smart contracts to create an immutable ledger that records every transaction and interaction within the supply chain. By integrating with Hedera's distributed ledger technology and leveraging Docker for deployment, Eco-Trace ensures the integrity and security of the data, preventing tampering or fraud while maintaining scalability and flexibility.

The Eco-Trace DApp was developed with a user-friendly interface to make it accessible to consumers of all technical backgrounds. Users can easily enter product details such as brand name and date of manufacture to retrieve sustainability information in real-time.
