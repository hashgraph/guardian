## Introduction

Plastic waste poses a pressing global challenge, with vast amounts accumulating in landfills and ecosystems. The M/CE-R01 Circular Economy Methodology for Encouraging Plastic Recycling aims to address this issue by empowering and formalizing plastic recycling projects, particularly within the informal sector, to align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and foster a transition towards a circular economy (CE). By introducing circular plastic credits (CPCs) as incentives for responsible manufacturers, this framework seeks to incentivize investment in plastic recycling initiatives and drive systemic change in plastic usage and disposal practices.

Implemented effectively, this methodology holds the potential to not only mitigate environmental impacts but also empower communities involved in plastic recycling and provide transparent, verifiable data for informed decision-making. By catalyzing the adoption of sustainable practices and fostering collaboration across sectors, it offers a pathway towards a more sustainable and circular plastic economy.

## Scope

It covers a range of activities, including the establishment of new recycling facilities, capacity enhancements in existing facilities, retrofitting of idle facilities, and improvements in collection or sorting capacities. By providing options for involvement from both formal and informal sectors, the framework seeks to promote transparency, compliance, and accountability in plastic recycling initiatives while contributing to the transition towards a circular economy.

## Applicability

This methodology is applicable to projects meeting the following criteria:

- Plastic waste sourced from various locations including land, water bodies, dumpsites, and urban areas, among others.
- Recycling of plastic types such as PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, PP, PS, and others as outlined in the VPCE's Protocol.
- Compliance with local and national regulations, ensuring environmental and social safeguards.
- Accurate estimation of recycled plastic volume, either through direct monitoring or mass balance approach.
- Maintenance of an identifiable end-use market for recycled plastic, excluding fuel production.
- Proper management of non-recycled plastic waste to prevent environmental contamination.
- Implementation of contractual agreements for monitored use of recycled plastic by end consumers.
- Non-competition or diversion of plastic waste from other recycling facilities.

- Special conditions apply to projects involving chemical recycling, imported plastic waste, collection activities prioritizing local employment and gender equality, informal recycling facilities, and transboundary movements, each with specific compliance requirements outlined within the methodology.
  
## Project Boundary

The project boundary spans from the sites where plastic waste originates to its ultimate utilization as raw material. This includes the initial generation sites, waste collection points, gathering and sorting facilities, as well as plastic waste recycling facilities. Furthermore, it extends to identifiable plants or retailers where the recycled plastic serves as feedstock for industrial processes or the manufacturing of new products.

## Baseline Scenarios

For plastic recycling, the baseline scenarios correspond to the amount of plastic waste that would have been recycled in the project area.

## Policy Workflow

## Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera Testnet and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) which is attached above. 
 
## Available Roles

- PCEM Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined in the VPCE PDD and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the PCEM participant receives circular plastic credit (CPC) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.  
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB or VPCE) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
Cercarbono and Allcot are using Icontec as their VVB.
- Registry (EcoRegistry) - EcoRegistry serves as the registry for the VPCE under Cercarbono and Allcot. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.

## Comparative Analysis (M/CE-R01 vs PWRM002)
Circular economy and plastic recycling can help displace the production of virgin materials in dedicated facilities, potentially resulting in the avoidance of energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

- M/CE-R01 includes a guide for calculating GHG emissions from plastic waste recycling (which wasn't included in the PWRM002 methodology), emphasizing the importance of emission reduction through recycling. By promoting the formalization of plastic recycling projects, the methodology aims to increase recycling rates and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action.
- M/CE-R01 factored in the recycling process (chemical or mechanical) in the baseline scenario, project scenario, leakage calculation, and net plastic recycled estimation while PWRM002 focused on depolymerization and non-depolymerization.
