## Introduction

The EcoRegen Alliance represents a pioneering effort to foster carbon sequestration through the innovative use of algae and other nature-based solutions. By leveraging the Guardian Managed Services framework alongside Hedera Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), we aim to create a transparent, efficient, and scalable ecosystem to facilitate the tracking, verification, and rewarding of carbon sequestration activities. This initiative not only aims at achieving net-zero carbon emissions but also at providing a sustainable pathway beyond, enhancing liquidity for operational and expansion activities of supply chain members.

## Algae Supply Chain Sequestration Methodology

The core of our methodology focuses on the carbon absorption capabilities of algae, following its journey from cultivation in open pond systems or modular bioreactor facilities through to the transformation of biomass into biochar and other carbon sequestration products. This process is meticulously tracked and verified using a combination of manual verification, IoT technologies, mass balancing, and satellite imaging to ensure the highest levels of accuracy and integrity in carbon sequestration data.

### Key Innovations:

- **Integration of Advanced Technologies:** Use of IoT, mass spectrometry, and satellite imaging for precise tracking and verification of carbon sequestration.
- **Transparent and Secure Data Management:** Data captured is securely stored on the Hedera DLT, ensuring transparency and immutability, leveraging the Guardian Managed Service.
- **Tokenization of Carbon Sequestration:** Minting of ECO tokens to encapsulate the value of sequestered carbon, providing tangible rewards and incentivizing further participation in carbon sequestration efforts.

## Policy Workflow

Our policy workflow incorporates the entire lifecycle of carbon sequestration from algae cultivation to the final biochar production and its utilization. In addition to the standard workflow that builds on the to Verra standard [VM0044](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Methodology%20Library/Verra/Verra%20Redd/VM0044), we've introduced a critical feature: the **Damage Report System**. This system is activated if our monitoring partner platforms detect any damage to a given batch of biochar associated with an ECO token, for instance, due to fire. It allows the Project Proponent, with the assistance of the Verifier or VVB (Verification and Validation Body), to accurately identify the tokenID of the affected batch, ensuring a timely and documented response including evidence, a date and time stamp, and reporter information.

## Policy Guide

This guide outlines the comprehensive approach adopted by the EcoRegen Alliance, focusing intially on the industrial process of algae cultivation to biochar production. It emphasizes the importance of streamlined, efficient practices, highlighting our commitment to sustainable biomass management.

## Important Documents & Schemas

- **Algae Cultivation to Biochar-based Carbon Sequestration:** Detailed documentation of the process, focusing on sustainable practices and carbon sequestration efficiency.
- **Damage Report System:** Guidelines and templates for reporting damages to biochar batches, ensuring transparency and accountability in the sequestration process.

## Token (Verified Carbon Unit)

The ECO Token symbolizes a unit of carbon that has been successfully sequestered, serving as a reward and tracking mechanism for carbon sequestration activities. It reflects our commitment to creating a sustainable ecosystem for carbon management and sequestration.

In addition, our plans include the minting of a secondary derivative token, the VECO, which will decrease annually by the golden ratio, which can be used for staking verifiers and rewarding providers of resource.

## Step By Step - Overview

1. **Algae Cultivation:** Initiation of the carbon sequestration process through algae cultivation.
2. **Biomass Transformation:** Conversion of harvested algae into biomass and subsequently into biochar, a stable form of carbon storage.
3. **Data Verification and Token Minting:** Collection, verification, and certification of data at each step of the process, culminating in the minting of ECO Tokens to represent sequestered carbon.
4. **Damage Reporting:** In case of damage detection, the process for submitting a detailed damage report, ensuring accurate identification and documentation of affected biochar batches.

# Algae-based Carbon Sequestration Policy

This guide outlines the steps to set up and use the Algae-based Carbon Sequestration Policy.

## Steps

1. **Create a new policy:** Navigate to the policy creation page and enter the required details such as policy name, description, and other relevant information.

2. **Define policy roles:** Specify the roles involved in the policy, such as Project Proponent and VVB (Validation and Verification Body).

3. **Configure Administrator settings:** Set up the necessary settings for the Administrator, including approving VVBs and managing the project pipeline.

4. **Project Proponent actions:**
   - Create new projects by filling out the project details form.
   - Assign individual named Verifiers (VVBs) to projects for validation.
   - Add monitoring reports for validated projects.
   - View and manage tokens associated with the projects.

5. **VVB actions:**
   - Create a new VVB account and wait for approval from the Administrator.
   - Once approved, validate assigned projects and approve or reject them.
   - Verify monitoring reports submitted by Project Proponents.

6. **Administrator project management:**
   - Review and approve projects added by Project Proponents.
   - Monitor the status of projects and track their progress.

7. **Monitoring Reports:**
   - Project Proponents submit monitoring reports for their projects.
   - VVBs verify the submitted monitoring reports and approve or reject them.
   - The Administrator reviews and approves the verified monitoring reports.

8. **Token Minting:**
   - The Administrator initiates the token minting process for approved monitoring reports.
   - The system mints tokens based on the carbon sequestration data provided in the reports.

9. **Damage Reports:**
   - If any damage occurs to the algae-based carbon sequestration, a damage report can be submitted.
   - VVBs review and validate the damage reports.
   - The Administrator takes necessary actions based on the validated damage reports, such as retiring the affected tokens.

10. **Token Retirement:**
    - When carbon sequestration is damaged or destroyed, the corresponding tokens can be retired.
    - The Administrator approves the token retirement based on damage reports initiated by the VVB.

11. **Reporting and Monitoring:**
    - The Administrator monitors the overall carbon sequestration progress and generates reports.
    - Project Proponents and VVBs can access relevant reports and data related to their projects.

12. **Policy Updates:**
    - The Administrator can make updates to the policy as needed, such as adding new roles, modifying existing processes, or introducing new features.
    - Any changes to the policy should be communicated to all stakeholders.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the Algae-based Carbon Sequestration Policy to manage carbon sequestration projects, mint tokens, and ensure the integrity of the process.
