### Introduction 

Evercity Platform automates the creation of the Project Design Document (PDD) as part of the carbon origination flow. The Platform has integrated the ![VERRA Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Methodology%20Library/Verra/Verra%20Redd/VerraARR) (ARR) area-based policy and implanted the forward minting module. The VM0047 methodology not only quantifies the carbon removal potential of afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects, but it also takes into account the emissions resulting from the burning of biomass and the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Furthermore, the policy enables issuance of Guardian-based carbon forwards for the VM0047 methodology.

### Need and use for VM0047 Policy with the Forward Module

Climate Project Proponents face substantial upfront costs distributed among various stakeholders, including Project Developers, Standards, and Auditors, as well as implementation costs of the project itself, while the carbon credits are typically issued 1-3 years after the project start, with no guarantee of purchase by offtakers.
The Evercity Platform enables the issuance of Guardian-based carbon forwards for the VM0047 methodology, allowing the climate projects to raise early stage financing, as they provide critical early-stage funding necessary for the Project Proponent to cover the carbon consulting and implementation costs.

### Policy workflow

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent creating the project on the Evercity Platform. After they create the Project Idea Note (PIN) using the Evercity PIN Builder, they proceed to identify relevant project partners using the Evercity Service Providers Listing. Together with the selected partner, they create the Project Design Document (PDD). The PDD includes project details, and ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters to demonstrate alignment with the VCS. Once provided the necessary information, the Guardian automatically calculates the project’s baselines, as well as project’s net GHG emissions reductions and removals. The Registry then adds the project to the pipeline on the Guardian. Next, the Project Proponent assigns the VVB that can be found on the Evercity Service Providers Listing, to validate the PDD and provide the Validation Statement on the TrustChain. Once the project has been validated by the VVB, the Project Proponent can issue the Guardian-native carbon forwards in order to raise upfront finance.

### Available roles 

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the ARR project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VM0047 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities. Upon successful validation, the project proponent receives Carbon Forwards (CF), representing the carbon credits with a delayed delivery.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VM0047 guidelines.

3. **Registry (Verra)** - Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports.

### Token

Carbon Forwards (CF) are prepaid carbon credit purchase agreements between the Carbon Forward Buyer and the Project Proponent. As per the Carbon Forward Agreement the Project Proponent commits to deliver the carbon credits at a given time in the future to the Forward Buyer. Carbon Forwards are providing critical early-stage funding necessary for the Project Owner to cover the carbon consulting and implementation costs.
On the other hand, the Carbon Forwards enable the Buyers to benefit from the price upside, by securing high-quality carbon credits at the most favorable prices. They can sell Forwards at any time and receive yield from web3-enabled liquidity pools while holding them. 
Once the emission reductions have been verified by a Validation/Verification Body (VVB), the Standard issues carbon credits to the project owner who then delivers the credits to the forward holder.
