## Introduction

Biochar - a substance with remarkable ability to sequester carbon for extended periods, accounts for [95% of all delivered carbon removal credits](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alliedoffsets_did-you-know-that-biochar-credits-are-responsible-activity-7183056009458782208-q-2h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) today. Puro Standard's [Biochar Methodology Edition 2022 V3](https://7518557.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7518557/Supplier%20Documents/Puro.earth%20Biochar%20Methodology.pdf) provides a clear framework for converting biomass into biochar. This methodology is a key part of managing organic waste and fighting climate change by removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it for the long-term.

By using the methodology, suppliers take a responsible approach to dealing with organic waste. They use biochar to help reduce atmospheric carbon levels. The process includes strict lifecycle assessments to make sure the carbon captured during photosynthesis gets locked into the biochar and takes much longer to be released compared to letting the biomass decay naturally.

The methodology uses robust tools for carefully calculating emissions. These tools account for each stage of the biochar lifecycle, from obtaining the biomass to using the biochar. They provide a systematic way to determine the emission reductions and carbon storage achieved.

## Need and Use for the Puro Standard Biochar Methodology Policy

Digitizing the Biochar methodology makes it more accessible and efficient. It enables transparent and accurate emissions reporting, project monitoring, and certification processes. Using this policy built on Hedera Guardian offers several key advantages:

- Immutable record keeping on a tamperproof ledger
- Transparent tracking and auditing of biomass sourcing, biochar production, and carbon crediting
- Automated and streamlined data collection and reporting
- Secure sharing of data between suppliers, auditors, and the carbon registry
- Easier integration with IoT sensors for real-time monitoring
- Reduced administrative costs and human error
- Credibility and trust through the use of an enterprise-grade public DLT network

This combination of a robust, scientifically-grounded methodology and an efficient, transparent digital workflow can accelerate the adoption of biochar as a carbon removal solution. It gives suppliers the tools and incentives to manage organic waste sustainably while making a measurable impact on climate change.

### Token (CO2 Removal Certificate)

Each CORC is a token representing one metric ton of CO2 sequestered through biochar application as verified by Puro Standard's methodology.

### Step by Step Workflow

1. Role Selection
- Users begin by selecting their role: either as a **CO2 Removal Supplier** or as an **Auditor**.
  <img width="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gautamp8/guardian/assets/9518151/d1ff3c08-a855-4924-9f04-fc37eb898c25">

2. Profile Approval

- **CO2 Removal Suppliers** and **Auditors** submit their profiles for approval. Suppliers must provide KYC documentation & Platform agreement to register.

5. Audit Approval

- After a thorough review, the **Auditor** approves the facility, confirming it meets the necessary criteria for sustainable biochar production.

6. Production Commencement

- Following audit approval, the **CO2 Removal Supplier** can begin biochar production.

6. Monitoring Report Submission

- For a specified monitoring period, the **CO2 Removal Supplier** is required to submit **Monitoring Report**.
- These report detail the biochar production volume, carbon sequestration, and adherence to the biochar application requirements.

- Upon validation, the **Registry** issues **CORCs**, which represent the net carbon removal achieved through the Supplier’s biochar production.

9. Trust Chain Visibility

- The entire process is recorded in a trust chain, providing a transparent and immutable record of the biochar production and certification process.
- Stakeholders can view the trust chain to ensure the integrity and validity of the biochar’s carbon sequestration credentials.
