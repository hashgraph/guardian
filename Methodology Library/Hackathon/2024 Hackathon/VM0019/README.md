# VM0019 Fuel Switch from Gasoline toEthanol in Flex-Fuel Vehicle Fleets

The VM0019 policy envisions a future where commercial fleets operate predominantly on ethanol, a renewable fuel source that not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to energy security and economic growth. By harnessing the potential of ethanol, we aim to drive a paradigm shift in the way we power our vehicles, moving away from fossil fuels towards cleaner, more sustainable alternatives. This methodology is applicable to project activities that aim at complete substitution of gasoline or gasoline blends by ethanol in commercial fleets of flex-fuel vehicles.

## Introduction
The VM0019 policy methodology is a pioneering initiative aimed at transitioning commercial fleets from gasoline to ethanol, leveraging renewable fuel sources to enhance environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.

## Policy overview

VM0019 aims at:
- Encouraging the adoption of ethanol as the primary fuel in flex-fuel vehicles, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency.
- Supporting the development and maintenance of ethanol fueling infrastructure to ensure fleet accessibility.
- Establishing a trust chain for the ethanol fuel supply. This ensures that ethanol used in commercial fleets is verified as being produced from renewable sources, enhancing the credibility of the transition to ethanol.
- Ultimately a greener future for everybody.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Standard Registry (Verra)** - It is responsible for approving the VVBs as well as projects submitted by the Project Proponent. It is also entrusted with review Monitoring reports as well as Project Descriptions which is necessary for Project pipeline.
- **Project Proponent** - It is responsible for creating new projects which are in accordance with the policy and submitting monitoring reports from time to time to apply for credits on succesful verfication.
- **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - It has to be approved by the Verra registry. It is an independent body tasked with veryfing the data submitted by the project proponent. Based on their findings they can approve or reject the claims of the project proponent.

## Workflow
The workflow commences with the Project Initiator submitting the project proposal (PP) to Verra. This proposal will encompass preliminary estimates of the monitoring parameters, along with additional project details to showcase compliance with the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) program criteria. Following this, Verra incorporates the PP and project documentation into the Project Pipeline and Project Registry. Subsequently, the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will evaluate and validate the PP, issuing a Validation Report. The Project Initiator then proceeds with monitoring and generates a Monitoring Report, substituting the preliminary estimates with post-monitoring data and submits it to the VVB. The VVB subsequently verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement. Ultimately, Verra reviews the issuance request and Verified Carbon Units (VCUs), which are then awarded to the Project Initiator.

The workflow has been explained in the diagram given below
