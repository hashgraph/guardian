# ZEV Ledger: Tokenization & management of ZEV credits in alignment with the "VM0038 Methodology for Electric Vehicle Charging Systems" and "Two and Three Wheeled Personal Transportation" methodologies

## Overview

ZEV Ledger is a decentralized ledger system built on the Hedera network for managing Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits. It provides a transparent and secure platform for tracking, verifying, and trading ZEV credits, promoting the adoption of zero-emission vehicles and reducing carbon emissions. 

## Features

- **Decentralized Ledger**: Built on the Hedera network, ensuring transparency, security, and scalability.
- **ZEV Credit Management**: Allows stakeholders to register, verify, and trade ZEV credits securely.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among project developers, validation verification bodies (VVBs), registry admins, and auditors.
- **Compliance and Audit**: Ensures compliance with ZEV regulations and standards through verification and audit processes.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes smart contracts for automating ZEV credit transactions and ensuring trustless interactions.
