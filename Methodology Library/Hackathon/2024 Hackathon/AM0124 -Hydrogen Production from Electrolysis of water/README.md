### Introduction

The Large-scale Methodology AM0124 establishes guidelines for the production of hydrogen through the electrolysis of water, utilizing electricity from captive renewable power plants or a combination of renewable sources and the electric grid. This methodology applies to projects supplying hydrogen to existing dedicated consumers and ensures emissions reduction through fuel or feedstock switch and renewable energy utilization.

### Need and Use for the AM0124 policy

AM0124 addresses the urgent need to transition towards sustainable hydrogen production methods by harnessing renewable energy sources. By promoting electrolysis of water with electricity from captive renewable power plants, this methodology facilitates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional hydrogen production methods. AM0124 encourages the construction of new renewable power plants and electrolyser hydrogen production facilities, driving innovation and investment in clean energy infrastructure. Furthermore, the methodology ensures transparency and accountability through rigorous validation and verification processes, contributing to the global effort to combat climate change and advance towards a low-carbon future.

The project proponent begins by drafting a project design document (AM0124) detailing the hydrogen production process through water electrolysis using electricity from captive renewable power plants or a combination of renewable and grid electricity. The document includes project description, additionality demonstration, baseline scenario, and estimated emissions reductions. Verra and the Validation/Verification Body (VVB) review the project design document for compliance. Upon approval, Hydrogen Switch Credits (HSC) are issued by Verra. The project is registered and added to the registry, and project activities commence in accordance with AM0124 guidelines. Monitoring of key parameters is conducted as outlined in the methodology. Monitored data is compiled into a monitoring report, which undergoes review by the VVB. Upon successful review, the project progresses through the project pipeline for further processing, potentially leading to additional HSC issuance based on verified emission reductions.

### Policy guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can be imported via Github (.policy file)

### Available roles

**Project Proponent** - Responsible for initiating and executing hydrogen production projects as per the AM0124 methodology. They adhere to the methodology's requirements, providing evidence of project activities, such as electricity consumption, hydrogen production, and emission reductions achieved. Upon successful validation and verification, the project proponent receives Hydrogen Switch Credits (HSC) as an incentive for their emission reductions.

**Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - Independently validates and verifies project data submitted by the project proponent. They assess the project design document, including additionality demonstration and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies monitoring reports and ensures compliance with AM0124 guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB approves or rejects projects for registration and credit issuance.

**Registry (Verra)** - Manages project intake, pipeline, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports for projects following the AM0124 methodology. Verra ensures compliance with methodology requirements before issuing Hydrogen Switch Credits (HSC) to approved projects.

### Token issued

Hydrogen Switch Credit (HSC), each equivalent to (1) tonne of CO2 saved by transitioning to sustainable hydrogen production.
