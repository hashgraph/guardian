## Introduction:
In most developing countries, waste handling is a menace and most if not all ends up in a landfills, which in turn poses a greater risk to sorrounding communities and is responsible for  production of methane gas.
With proper waste segregation and handling, lots of waste that could otherwise end up in a landfill, could be reused, recycled or composted thereby overstretching landfills in most countries.
In many developing countries  urban areas waste collection services are inadequate or non-existent, Lack of proper infrastructure, equipment, and funding for waste collection services leads to the accumulation of waste in public spaces and illegal dumping. 

[IWCSH policy ](https://github.com/kephothoX/guardian/tree/main) incentivises both formal and informal waste collectors who  play a significant role in waste collection and recycling of valuable materials from waste. 


## Need of IWCSH

Waste management is a challenge to many nations around the worth and its effect on climate change.
- Landfills alone are responsible for approx 14% of all global methane emissions.
- Mismanaged or over stretched landfills posses greater risk to nearby communities.
- Recycling and reusing waste products promotes circular economy keeping resources safe and long, also reducing impact waste has on our environment.
- Composting reduces landfill methane gas emissions.
-Minted tokens provides finance and incentives to project proponents.


## Policy Description:
IWCSH policy  emphasizes on waste segregation, recycling, composting, and responsible disposal methods, in turn significantly reducing  environmental impact  from poorly handled waste and contributing  towards mitigating climate change.

Tokens can only be minted after a project and reports has been approved by external project Verifier.

## Roles:

- Project Owner:  Creates a project and fills out project monitoring reports on waste segregation and handling.
- Project Verifier:  Verifies project and reports.

## Schemas:
- Project registry schema. Records data about a project i.e name, description. location, address, contact details,  e.t.c
- Waste segregation schema:  Waste segregation data (plastics, wet waste, harzadous waste e.t.t)
- Waste handling schema. Waste handling data (landfill, compostiong, recycling, reusing, e.t.c)

## Tokens:
-  IWCSH Token:   Issued to waste collection, segregation and  handling projects that use methods that promote climate mitigation measures in their operations, such as proper waste handling methods e.t.c
-  Waste Segregation Token: Issued to projects that demonstrate proven waste segregation in their reporting upon verification
-  Waste Handling Token (WHT): Issued to waste handling projects that promote methane and CO2 gas reduction in their operations

## Policy Baseline

Any waste that can be recycled, reused or composted goes along way towards reduction of landfill gasses and reduces amount of waste deposited on landfills.
