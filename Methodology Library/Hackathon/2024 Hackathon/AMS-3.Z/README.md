### Introduction

The Small-scale Methodology VM0038 for Fuel Switch, Process Improvement, and Energy Efficiency in Brick Manufacture addresses a critical need in the reduction of environmental challenges associated with energy consumption in brick production. This methodology offers a structured framework to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions resulting from various measures implemented in brick production facilities. These measures include shifting to alternative production technologies, substituting fossil fuels with renewable biomass, reducing fossil fuel consumption through process improvements, and modifying existing facilities to enhance energy efficiency.

### Need and use for the AMS-3.Z policy

The AMS-3.Z policy addresses a critical necessity in mitigating environmental challenges linked with brick manufacturing processes, particularly concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By furnishing a comprehensive framework for implementing fuel switch initiatives, process enhancements, and energy efficiency measures within brick manufacturing facilities, AMS-3.Z endeavors to alleviate environmental burdens and advocate for sustainability within the brick industry. Through its structured guidelines and procedures, AMS-3.Z promotes the adoption of renewable biomass and low-carbon fuels, contributing to climate change mitigation and resource conservation efforts. Furthermore, AMS-3.Z establishes transparent reporting and verification mechanisms, ensuring accountability among stakeholders and bolstering credibility in emission reduction initiatives within the brick manufacturing sector. With its global applicability and emphasis on sustainability, AMS-3.Z plays a pivotal role in advancing environmental stewardship and building resilient communities equipped to address the multifaceted impacts of environmental degradation.

### Policy Workflow

![Flowchart](https://github.com/hawk012/AMS-3.Z/assets/166325053/9b067f69-e42a-42a9-88bd-75758dd5eb93)

The project lifecycle begins with the Project Proponent creating a Project Design Document in accordance with Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) guidelines, outlining project details such as description, additionality demonstration, baseline scenario, project intervention, and estimated emissions saved. Following submission, the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) reviews the document to ensure compliance with methodology guidelines. Upon approval, Carbon Reduction Credits (CRC) are issued by Verra. Subsequently, the project commences, with the Proponent implementing activities like fuel switching or energy efficiency measures, monitored as per AMZ.3.2 guidelines. Data collected is compiled into a Monitoring Report, reviewed by the VVB for accuracy and adherence to guidelines. Upon successful verification, the project enters the pipeline for further processing, potentially leading to additional CRC issuance. Throughout, stakeholders, including the Project Proponent, VVB, and Verra, ensure transparency and methodology guideline adherence.

### Policy guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can be imported via Github (.policy file)

### Available roles

**Project Proponent** - Leads energy efficiency or fuel-switch projects, provides evidence for CRC issuance, and ensures compliance with AMS-3.Z guidelines.

**Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - Independently validates project data, assesses guideline adherence, and approves projects for CRC issuance.

**Registry (Verra)** - Manages project intake, reviews compliance, and issues CRCs after ensuring alignment with AMS-3.Z requirements.

### Token issued

Carbon Reduction Credit (CRC), each equivalent to one tonne of CO2 saved through sustainable practices in brick manufacturing.
