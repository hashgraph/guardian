### Introduction

The AMS-III.C methodology offers a comprehensive approach to reducing emissions through the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in passenger and freight transportation. It addresses the pressing need to mitigate environmental challenges associated with fossil fuel consumption by facilitating the transition to cleaner transportation alternatives. By outlining specific criteria for project applicability, performance specifications for batteries, and measures to prevent double counting of emission reductions, AMS-III.C ensures transparency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle. Furthermore, it promotes compliance with prevailing regulations and encourages the use of renewable energy sources for vehicle charging, thereby advancing sustainability objectives. 

# Need and use for the AMS-3.C Policy


The AMS-III.C methodology serves as a vital tool in addressing environmental challenges by facilitating the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in passenger and freight transportation. Its structured approach offers clear guidelines for project implementation, ensuring transparency and accountability in emission reduction efforts. By promoting the displacement of fossil fuel vehicles with cleaner alternatives, AMS-III.C contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing sustainability goals. Additionally, its provisions for battery performance specifications and measures to prevent double counting of emission reductions enhance project integrity. AMS-III.C encourages compliance with regulations and supports the use of renewable energy sources for vehicle charging, further promoting environmental stewardship. With a focus on comparability between project and baseline vehicles and a defined limit on emission reductions, AMS-III.C provides a reliable framework for achieving substantial emission reductions while fostering sustainable transportation practices.

### Policy workflow

![Flowchart (1)](https://github.com/Funda002/AMS-3.C/assets/166327233/b5451472-3147-469a-a30e-fe42816b6ba4)
The workflow begins with the Project Proponent creating a Project Design Document following the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) guidelines, including project details, additionality, baseline scenario (petroleum emissions), project intervention (electric and hybrid vehicles), and estimated emission reductions. The Validation and Verification Body (VVB) reviews this document. Upon approval from the VVB and Verra's review, Carbon Reduction Credits (CRC) are issued. The project is then added to the registry, and the Project Proponent starts implementing activities like deploying electric vehicles. These activities are monitored as per the AMZ.3.2 guidelines, with data compiled in a Monitoring Report reviewed by the VVB. After verification, the project is added to the pipeline for potential issuance of additional CRCs based on the verified emission reductions.

### Policy guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can be imported via Github (.policy file)

### Available roles

**Project Proponent**: Initiates and executes the electric/hybrid vehicle project, ensuring compliance with AMS-III.C guidelines and providing evidence of project activities.
**Validation and Verification Body (VVB)**: Independently validates and verifies project data, assessing adherence to methodology guidelines for emission reduction claims.
**Registry (Verra)**: Manages project intake, reviews documentation, and oversees issuance of Carbon Reduction Credits (CRCs) upon successful validation.

### Token issued 

Carbon Reduction Credit (CRC): Equivalent to one tonne of CO2 saved by the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles, incentivizing emission reduction efforts.
