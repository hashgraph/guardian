### Introduction 

The VM0038 Methodology for Electric Vehicle Charging Systems offers a structured approach to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions attributed to the operation of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. This methodology specifically addresses the displacement of emissions from traditional fossil fuel vehicles by leveraging the electricity supplied through project chargers. Its primary focus lies in providing accessible monitoring parameters for quantifying emission reductions. Additionally, VM0038 establishes default factors for estimating key parameters, offering a convenient alternative for projects situated in the United States and Canada.

### Need and use for VM0038 Policy

The VM0038 Policy for Electric Vehicle Charging Systems fulfills a crucial need in addressing environmental challenges associated with transportation energy consumption. As societies worldwide strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition towards sustainable transportation solutions, there is a pressing demand for standardized methodologies to quantify the environmental benefits of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. VM0038 serves as a structured framework for evaluating GHG emission reductions achieved through the displacement of emissions from conventional fossil fuel vehicles by utilizing electricity from project chargers. By providing user-friendly monitoring parameters and establishing default factors for estimation, VM0038 simplifies the process of assessing emission reductions, particularly for projects in regions like the United States and Canada.

### Policy workflow

The workflow starts with the Project Proponent creating a project design document (VM0038) for Verra, which includes project details, additionality demonstration, baseline scenario, and estimated emission reductions. The Validation and Verification Body (VVB) reviews this document along with Verra. Once approved, Verra issues Carbon Reduction Credits (CRC). The project is then added to the registry, and the project activities are monitored as per the VM0038 guidelines. The monitored parameters are documented in a monitoring report, which is again reviewed by the VVB before proceeding further.

### Available roles 

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the electric vehicle charging project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VM0038 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities, such as installation of EV charging infrastructure, electricity consumption data, and emission reductions achieved. Upon successful validation and verification, the project proponent receives Carbon Reduction Credits (CRC) as an incentive for their emission reductions.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VM0038 guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration and credit issuance.

3. **Registry (Verra)** - Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports. This process ensures that electric vehicle charging projects meet the VM0038 methodology requirements before Carbon Reduction Credits (CRC) are issued. Verra also oversees the issuance of CRCs to approved projects.

### Token

Carbon Reduction Credit (CRC), each equivalent to one tonne of CO2 emissions reduced through the implementation of electric vehicle charging systems.
