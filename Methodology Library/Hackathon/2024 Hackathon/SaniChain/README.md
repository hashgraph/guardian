# SaniChain
SaniChain is a methodology that helps people who want to eat healthily find restaurants that promote menus that are friendly to them, with low carbon consumption, and traceable.

## Policy Description
SaniChain is committed to promoting healthy eating habits while minimizing carbon footprint through its innovative methodology. Our platform facilitates individuals seeking health-conscious dining options by connecting them with restaurants that prioritize sustainable practices, offer low-carbon menu options, and provide traceable ingredients.

Moreover, SaniChain empowers restaurants to effortlessly generate carbon credits through our platform. By implementing sustainable practices and reducing their carbon emissions, restaurants can easily accrue carbon credits, further incentivizing their commitment to environmental responsibility.

SaniChain ensures a transparent and auditable process. Our approach focuses on Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) to accurately capture carbon emissions and establish a reliable audit trail. This process is anchored by individual actors who have undergone rigorous validation and verification procedures.

Each actor within the SaniChain ecosystem possesses unique cryptographic keys, aligning with the W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DID), Verifiable Credentials (VC), and Verifiable Presentations (VP). These standards ensure the integrity and security of transactions, providing stakeholders with confidence in the authenticity of data.

SaniChain utilizes the Hedera Hashgraph public Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Hedera's Guardian, an open-source reference implementation of the IWA's Voluntary Ecological Markets Standards, to facilitate seamless interactions within our ecosystem.

In addition to adhering to established carbon methodologies, SaniChain introduces a novel concept whereby carbon credits are retired in exchange for restaurant coupon discounts. This innovative approach creates a new carbon credit market wherein end-users can purchase credits to receive discounts on their dining experiences. By incentivizing consumers beyond traditional carbon credit gains, SaniChain empowers restaurants to attract a broader user base while promoting sustainability.

Our platform continues to serve as a bridge between individuals and restaurants that prioritize sustainability. By offering a curated selection of eateries committed to eco-friendly practices and low-carbon menus, SaniChain ensures that users can make informed choices that align with their health and environmental values.

The SaniChain project encompasses the entire lifecycle of a meal, from ingredient sourcing and preparation to consumption and waste management. It involves various stakeholders, including:

**Restaurants:** Develop sustainable menus, implement eco-friendly practices, and earn carbon credits.
**Project Developers:** Register projects and submit documentation for verification.
**Independent Verifiers:** Assess and validate carbon emission reduction claims.
**Policy Providers:** Define standards and methodologies for carbon accounting.
**3rd Party Data Providers:** Supply additional data for verification and analysis.
**End Users:** Purchase tokenized carbon credits and redeem them for restaurant discounts.

The SaniChain workflow can be divided into two main phases: Project Development & Verification and Carbon Credit Generation & Utilization.

### Phase 1: Project Development & Verification

**Project Registration:** Restaurants or project developers register their projects with SaniChain, providing details about their sustainability initiatives.
**Document Submission:** Project developers submit relevant documents, such as supplier certifications, meal production processes, and menu descriptions.
**Verification Body (VB) Review:** Independent verifiers assess the project documentation and conduct on-site inspections if necessary.
**Approval/Rejection:** Based on the VB's review, the project is either approved and proceeds to the next phase or rejected with an option to resubmit after addressing the concerns.

### Phase 2: Carbon Credit Generation & Utilization

**MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification):** Once approved, the project undergoes continuous monitoring of carbon emissions and health impacts using established methodologies.
**Report Issuance:** Based on the MRV data, a report detailing carbon emission reduction and health benefits is issued.
**Token Minting:** Corresponding to the verified carbon reduction, Sani Health Tokens are minted on the Hedera Hashgraph DLT.
**Marketplace Listing:** The minted tokens are listed on the SaniChain marketplace, making them available for purchase by end users.
**Carbon Credit Purchase:** End users browse the marketplace and purchase tokenized carbon credits using SANI tokens.
**Discount Redemption:** Users can exchange their purchased carbon credits for restaurant coupons, receiving discounts on their meals.
**Coupon Selection and Use:** End users select the desired restaurant and utilize their discount coupons.
**Token Retirement:** Upon coupon redemption, the corresponding carbon credits are retired, ensuring they are not double-counted.

## Additional Features:
**Food Waste Management:** The workflow emphasizes responsible food waste management through recycling and composting.
**Nutritional Analysis:** SaniChain provides nutritional information about menu items, empowering users to make informed choices.
**CO2 Capture:** The platform promotes carbon capture technologies to further offset emissions.

## Benefits:

* Promotes healthy eating habits.
* Encourages restaurants to adopt sustainable practices.
* Creates a transparent and auditable carbon credit market.
* Provides economic incentives for both restaurants and consumers.
