The SaniChain project encompasses the entire lifecycle of a meal, from ingredient sourcing and preparation to consumption and waste management. It involves various stakeholders, including:

**Restaurants:** Develop sustainable menus, implement eco-friendly practices, and earn carbon credits.
**Project Developers:** Register projects and submit documentation for verification.
**Independent Verifiers:** Assess and validate carbon emission reduction claims.
**Policy Providers:** Define standards and methodologies for carbon accounting.
**3rd Party Data Providers:** Supply additional data for verification and analysis.
**End Users:** Purchase tokenized carbon credits and redeem them for restaurant discounts.

The SaniChain workflow can be divided into two main phases: Project Development & Verification and Carbon Credit Generation & Utilization.

### Phase 1: Project Development & Verification

**Project Registration:** Restaurants or project developers register their projects with SaniChain, providing details about their sustainability initiatives.
**Document Submission:** Project developers submit relevant documents, such as supplier certifications, meal production processes, and menu descriptions.
**Verification Body (VB) Review:** Independent verifiers assess the project documentation and conduct on-site inspections if necessary.
**Approval/Rejection:** Based on the VB's review, the project is either approved and proceeds to the next phase or rejected with an option to resubmit after addressing the concerns.

### Phase 2: Carbon Credit Generation & Utilization

**MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification):** Once approved, the project undergoes continuous monitoring of carbon emissions and health impacts using established methodologies.
**Report Issuance:** Based on the MRV data, a report detailing carbon emission reduction and health benefits is issued.
**Token Minting:** Corresponding to the verified carbon reduction, Sani Health Tokens are minted on the Hedera Hashgraph DLT.
**Marketplace Listing:** The minted tokens are listed on the SaniChain marketplace, making them available for purchase by end users.
**Carbon Credit Purchase:** End users browse the marketplace and purchase tokenized carbon credits using SANI tokens.
**Discount Redemption:** Users can exchange their purchased carbon credits for restaurant coupons, receiving discounts on their meals.
**Coupon Selection and Use:** End users select the desired restaurant and utilize their discount coupons.
**Token Retirement:** Upon coupon redemption, the corresponding carbon credits are retired, ensuring they are not double-counted.

## Additional Features:
**Food Waste Management:** The workflow emphasizes responsible food waste management through recycling and composting.
**Nutritional Analysis:** SaniChain provides nutritional information about menu items, empowering users to make informed choices.
**CO2 Capture:** The platform promotes carbon capture technologies to further offset emissions.
