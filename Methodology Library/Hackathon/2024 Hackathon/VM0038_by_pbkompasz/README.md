### Introduction&#x20;

Verra VM0038 presents an approach to reduce GHG emissions by deploying electric charging stations. This methodology is a crucial step in reaching net-zero goals. The transportation sector is responsible for 25% of GHG emissions worldwide. The policy's aim is to reduce GHG emissions from conventional ICE vehicles in regions where the market penetration of PEVs is under 5%. Despite the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, mainstream adoption is hindered by concerns over limited range and inadequate charging infrastructure.

### Key Objectives and Scope&#x20;

The primary objective of VM0038 revolves around mitigating GHG emissions by replacing ICE vehicles with low-emission BEV equivalents. This methodology encompasses the deployment of public charging systems, including Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast Chargers. Associated infrastructure, such as solar panels and battery packs, plays a crucial role in achieving even lower CO2 emissions. The methodology also includes the VMD0049 module, specifying regions where this methodology is applicable, particularly countries and sub-regions with EV market penetration below 5%.

### Need and Use for the Verra VM0038 Policy &#x20;

The transportation sector accounts for 25% of current global emissions, emphasizing the urgency for action. Electrifying the transportation system for both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles is a critical solution. However, the lack of charging infrastructure poses a significant obstacle.

Moreover, this policy provides a clear framework for measuring and evaluating CO2 reductions. By tracking the energy source for each charge and vehicle consumption, baseline emissions for ICE vehicles can be accurately calculated.

Additionally, this policy marks a milestone as the first in the Guardian focusing on the transportation sector. Finally, the original methodology is an evolution of CDM’s AMS-III.C, which focused on emission reductions by electric and hybrid vehicles.

### Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp. &#x20;

Policy:&#x20;

### Available Roles 

- Project Participant: Responsible for executing emission reduction projects, adhering to Verra's requirements, and providing evidence of achieved emission reductions. Successful verification results in Certified Emission Reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive.

- Verification and Validation Body (VVB): Independently verifies and validates project data, assessing emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to policy guidelines. The VVB either approves or rejects projects for registration based on evaluation.

- Registry (Verra): Facilitates registration and management of projects within the policy framework.

### Important Documents & Schemas 

1. Methodological Tool 01- Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality&#x20;
2. Methodological Tool 21- Demonstration of additionality of small-scale project activities
3. VMD0049 - Activity Method for Determining Additionality of
Electric Vehicle Charging Systems
4. Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc.
5. Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions. These includes 4 different equations with which the emission reductions can be calculated.
6. Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.

### Token (Carbon Emission Reduction) &#x20;

Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2.

### Step by Step

1. Log in as the Standard Registry and import the policy.

2. To start using the policy you first have to change the status of the policy from “Draft” to “Dry Run” or “Publish”, then select the “Register” button.

3. Create a new user by clicking the “Create User” button and assign their role as Project Participant.

4. The Project Participant can now submit their name or the name they would like to see reflect when registering for this project (i.e. their organization’s name).

5. Сreate a new user again and assign their role as VVB.

6. The VVB can now provide their name or the name they would like users to see when reviewing projects (i.e. their organization’s name).

7. Log in as the SR and select the “Project Participant” or the “VVB” tab to view the documents submitted by the Project Participant and by the VVB. The SR can approve their requests by clicking on the “Approve" button.

8. Log in as the Project Participant and create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button.

9. Log back in as the VVB and after reviewing the document by selecting the “View Document” button, the SR can validate the project submitted by the Project Participant by clicking the “Validate” button. If the data does not satisfy the rules set by the SR, then the “Reject” button can be used.

10. Log in as the Project Participant and create a monitoring report by clicking on the “Add Report” button then fill out the monitoring report form.

11. After creating the monitoring report, the project participant assigns the VVB to verify it by navigating to the “Monitoring Reports” tab and selecting the dropdown under “Assign”.

12. Log in as the VVB and click the “Monitoring Reports” tab to review the document submitted by the Project Participant. After reviewing the monitoring report by selecting “View Document”, the VVB can select “Verify”.

13. Log in as the SR to review the monitoring report by selecting the “View Document” button in the “Monitoring Reports” tab. The SR can approve the monitoring report by selecting “Approve”. This will also trigger the minting process. You can see the minting status under “Status” change from “Minting” to “Minted”.

14. Once the minting process is completed, you can view the token amount by selecting the “VPs” tab.

15. The TrustChain can also be viewed by clicking on the “View TrustChain” button.
