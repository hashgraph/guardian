# Policy Description
SaniChain is committed to promoting healthy eating habits while minimizing carbon footprint through its innovative methodology. Our platform facilitates individuals seeking health-conscious dining options by connecting them with restaurants that prioritize sustainable practices, offer low-carbon menu options, and provide traceable ingredients.

Moreover, SaniChain empowers restaurants to effortlessly generate carbon credits through our platform. By implementing sustainable practices and reducing their carbon emissions, restaurants can easily accrue carbon credits, further incentivizing their commitment to environmental responsibility.

SaniChain ensures a transparent and auditable process. Our approach focuses on Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) to accurately capture carbon emissions and establish a reliable audit trail. This process is anchored by individual actors who have undergone rigorous validation and verification procedures.

Each actor within the SaniChain ecosystem possesses unique cryptographic keys, aligning with the W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DID), Verifiable Credentials (VC), and Verifiable Presentations (VP). These standards ensure the integrity and security of transactions, providing stakeholders with confidence in the authenticity of data.

SaniChain utilizes the Hedera Hashgraph public Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Hedera's Guardian, an open-source reference implementation of the IWA's Voluntary Ecological Markets Standards, to facilitate seamless interactions within our ecosystem.

In addition to adhering to established carbon methodologies, SaniChain introduces a novel concept whereby carbon credits are retired in exchange for restaurant coupon discounts. This innovative approach creates a new carbon credit market wherein end-users can purchase credits to receive discounts on their dining experiences. By incentivizing consumers beyond traditional carbon credit gains, SaniChain empowers restaurants to attract a broader user base while promoting sustainability.

Our platform continues to serve as a bridge between individuals and restaurants that prioritize sustainability. By offering a curated selection of eateries committed to eco-friendly practices and low-carbon menus, SaniChain ensures that users can make informed choices that align with their health and environmental values.
