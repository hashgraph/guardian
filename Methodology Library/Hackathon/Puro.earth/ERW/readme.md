## Introduction

Puro Standard's Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) Methodology Edition 2022 V1 is a **framework designed to facilitate the application of crushed silicate rocks to agricultural lands**, leading to the **sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide** through accelerated weathering processes. This methodology plays a crucial role in the broader context of climate change mitigation by enhancing carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and ensuring its **long-term storage in the form of stable carbonate minerals**.

By adopting the Puro Standard ERW Methodology, Suppliers engage in a systematic approach to applying silicate rock dust to soils, harnessing the natural weathering process to capture and store atmospheric carbon. 

The methodology is supported by robust procedural tools designed for meticulous emission calculations. These instruments account for each step in the **ERW lifecycle—from rock mining and processing to application and reporting**—providing a structured means to quantify the carbon sequestration achieved through the enhanced weathering process.!


## Need and Use for the Puro Standard Enhanced Rock Weathering Methodology Policy

Addressing the urgent need for effective carbon dioxide removal strategies is critical in the face of global climate change. The Puro Standard ERW Methodology offers a promising solution, guiding Suppliers in the application of silicate rock dust to agricultural soils, thereby accelerating the natural weathering process and sequestering atmospheric carbon. 

The process involves **rigorous lifecycle assessments, ensuring that the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is securely locked in stable mineral forms, effectively removing it from the carbon cycle for extended periods**. This policy not only represents an innovative approach to carbon removal but also aligns with the global efforts to achieve net-zero emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Through digitization, the methodology becomes **more accessible and efficient, enabling transparent and accurate emissions reporting, project monitoring, and certification processes**. It integrates digital tools that facilitate the management of ERW activities, ensuring data integrity and ease of policy compliance.
