# UrbanO2asis


UrbanO2asis is designed to encourage and facilitate urban greening initiatives that contribute to improving air quality and enhancing urban biodiversity. Increase green spaces, reduce pollutants!

The idea for UrbanO2asis stemmed from a deep recognition of two interconnected challenges faced by modern urban environments â€“ declining air quality and the need for more sustainable, green spaces in cities. As urbanization continues to accelerate, we've seen a significant impact on environmental health, particularly in air quality, which directly affects public health and quality of life. Additionally, the loss of natural green spaces in urban areas has led to a disconnect between city dwellers and the natural environment.
