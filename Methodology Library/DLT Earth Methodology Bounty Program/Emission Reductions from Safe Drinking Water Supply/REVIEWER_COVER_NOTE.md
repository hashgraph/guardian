# Reviewer cover note — VMR0015 / AMS-III.AV

Short orientation for a reviewer encountering this submission.

> **Review against the rectified v1.1.1 build.** The policy file at the root of this folder (`VMR0015.policy`) was exported from the freshly republished v1.1.1 testnet instance: account `0.0.8877029`, user topic `0.0.8877030`, issuer DID `did:hedera:testnet:B2fk9cdS5DEWadWgJaRqcM5mY5aDR4isa4RLcwm7K1GB_0.0.8877030`, policy uuid `e72bf20d-f12b-47d9-af92-5b8346abed33`, publish VC `urn:uuid:7de5b666-3b33-4b46-824b-bcc9fa078bbd` (issued 2026-05-06T23:12:34Z), policy IPFS `QmVQpKkGPyzDe9CwsK89um4w1RMqDowd6yXj9mQEjCTVBf`. The v1.0 instance referenced further down is preserved for traceability only. Full identifier set: [`evidence/ON_CHAIN_ARTIFACTS.md`](evidence/ON_CHAIN_ARTIFACTS.md).

## What you are looking at

A Hedera Guardian implementation of **VMR0015 v1.0** — Verra's registry-current
revision of the CDM small-scale methodology **AMS-III.AV** *(Low GHG-emitting
safe drinking water production systems)*. The methodology applies to projects
that displace household water-boiling (typically wood, charcoal, or LPG) with
mechanical treatment systems whose throughput and water quality are monitored.

## Why this is on the Verra side of the bounty

AMS-III.AV originated as a CDM Type-III small-scale methodology and was
adopted by Verra under VCS as VMR0015. The DLT Earth bounty page lists this
slot under the Verra column. The methodology is registered on Verra's
registry and used by active project developers; it is less common than VM0042
(agriculture) or VM0047 (ARR), so a reviewer focused on those families may
not have seen it before. The math is structurally identical to the CDM
original; VMR0015 adds two clarifications, both addressed here:

1. **Conditional leakage** — `LE_woody` is only counted when the pre-project
   fuel mix contains woody biomass. Prevents over-deduction on
   electric-baseline projects. **Implemented in `customLogicBlock` math.**
2. **Water-quality gate (math-layer)** — `wq_pass_rate` is computed inside
   `customLogicBlock.calculate_report_fields` from the per-test verdicts on
   the Monitoring Report. If the observed pass-rate falls below 0.95, `ER_total`
   is forced to 0 and the mint emits zero base units regardless of any upstream
   VVB or owner approval. **Implemented in `customLogicBlock` math.**

## What you can verify in 5 minutes

1. The policy is published on Hedera testnet — open
   [topic 0.0.8865880](https://hashscan.io/testnet/topic/0.0.8865880) and you
   will see 6 HCS messages corresponding to the 14 schemas + policy publish.
2. The calculation workbook is live — open the `xlsx`, change any input in the
   `Baseline` or `Project` sheet, and `WorkedExample!ER_net` updates in real
   time. No hardcoded results.
3. The recorded test in `tests/tc1_full_lifecycle.record` can be replayed in
   MGS by importing the policy and running the test fixture.

## Known gaps (honest disclosure)

| Item | Status | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| Calculation workbook | Present (8 sheets, 47 live formulas) | — |
| `customLogicBlock` formulas in policy | Present (1 active block: `calculate_report_fields`; dormant `calculate_project_fields` removed in corrective pass) | v1.1.0 will split into named blocks `calc_baseline / calc_project / calc_leakage / calc_net_er` for clearer audit |
| Uncertainty discount factor | Applied in workbook (`u_def = 0.89` per AMS-III.AV §B.7.4) | v1.1.0 will move this into the policy's `customLogicBlock` directly |
| Water-quality 0.95 hard gate | **Implemented in v1.0.0** — `customLogicBlock.calculate_report_fields` computes `wq_pass_rate` from per-test verdicts and forces `ER_total = 0` when below 0.95 | v1.1.0 will add an explicit `verificationFailed` VC path so reviewers see a typed rejection event instead of a silent zero-mint |
| Negative-ER handling | Workbook surfaces `FAIL` flag; v1.0.0 policy clamps to 0 | v1.1.0 will replace the silent clamp with an explicit `verificationFailed` VC path |
| Transformation blocks for Verra Project Hub | 0 blocks (no public Verra ingest API exists; consistent with merged GS-SDW and VM0047 precedents) | Optional roadmap item |

These gaps are documented openly because they are real and a reviewer would
find them. The policy is functional and on-chain at v1.0.0; v1.1.0 is the
follow-up if review surfaces specific requests.
