Cynk.io Policy

# 1 General description
The methodology is applicable to project activities that involve switching (complete or partial) from the use of carbon intensive energy source (or a mix of energy sources) of fossil fuel origin to renewable biomass or a mix of renewable biomass and fossil fuel in existing manufacturing facilities (e.g. steel, ceramics, aluminium, lime, clinker production) 

Fuel switching may also result in energy efficiency improvements, however the primary aim of project activity is to reduce emissions through fuel switching.

Monitoring will be carried out at an installation level within each VPA, in accordance with the methodology AMS-III.AS “Switch from fossil fuel to biomass in existing manufacturing facilities for non-energy applications”. Further guidance from the Gold Standard regarding Renewable Biomass in the Renewable Energy Activity Requirements document will also be adhered to and monitored in the supply chain.
# 2 Applicability
1. The baseline fossil fuel and the project biomass are consumed in thermal energy conversion equipment (e.g. furnaces, kilns, dryers) that are used in the manufacture of products (e.g. steel, ceramics, aluminium, lime, clinker). 
1. It shall be demonstrated, with historical data, that for at least the immediately prior three years to the start date of project, only fossil fuels (no renewable biomass) were used in the production systems, which are being modified, retrofitted or replaced. In cases where small quantities of biomass were used for experimental purposes then this can be excluded; 
1. Regulations do not restrict the use of the baseline fossil fuel or require the use of project biomass and low carbon energy sources unless widespread non-compliance (less than 50 per cent of manufacturing production activities comply in the country) of the local regulation is evidenced; 
1. The production process where the fuel switch takes place shall have a distinct energy input (i.e. specific fuels) and distinct output (i.e. intermediate or finished product). The output of each element process shall be an output for which an appropriate international / national standard or industrial norm exists 
1. This methodology is not applicable to project activities where primary output of the processes is energy (e.g. heat, electricity) that can be directly measured 
1. The product(s) (e.g. ceramic insulators, tiles, steel ingots, lime, aluminium cookware) produced in the industrial facility throughout the crediting period shall be equivalent to the product(s) produced in the baseline. For the purposes of this methodology, equivalent products are defined as products having the same use, the same general physical properties, and which function in a similar manner. In addition, products produced in the industrial facility throughout the crediting period shall provide the same level of service, or better, and be of the same level of quality, or better than the product(s) produced in the baseline. When national or international product standards apply to the product(s), product quality shall be as defined in such standards, otherwise the relevant industrial norms are to be followed; 
1. The type of input materials used in the project shall be homogeneous and similar to the input material that was used in the baseline and any deviation during the crediting period of input material type, composition, or amount used per unit of product output shall be within the range of ±15 per cent of the baseline characteristics and values; 
1. The facilities involving modification, retrofit and/or replacement shall not influence the production capacity beyond ±15 per cent of the baseline capacity. 
1. Any emissions reduction derived from chemical processes related to the transformation of raw materials in the industrial facilities are not eligible for claiming certified emission reductions (CERs). Examples include de-carbonisation of raw materials (i.e. CaCO3 and MgCO3 bearing minerals) in kiln producing clinker and utilisation of biomass as a reducing agent in metal ore reduction processes using charcoal.
1. The renewable biomass utilised by the project activity shall not be chemically processed (e.g. esterification to produce biodiesel, degumming and/or neutralisation by chemical reagents) prior to the combustion but it may be processed mechanically (e.g. pressing, filtering)/thermally (e.g. gasification to produce syngas).
1. This methodology is applicable to project activities that involve a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s); or a replacement of (an) existing plant(s) that must have been in operation for at least the immediately prior three years to the start date of the project activity. This requirement is in order to ensure that adequate baseline performance data are available. 
1. Farmer records shall be cross-checked with records from seed suppliers and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer suppliers. In case of discrepancies between farmer records and those from the respective suppliers, the most conservative value shall be taken. 
1. In case biomass is sourced from dedicated plantations, the applicability criteria in the tool “Project emissions from cultivation of biomass” shall apply. 
1. In cases where the project activity utilises charcoal produced from renewable biomass as fuel the requirements concerning demonstration of the remaining lifetime of the replaced equipment shall be met as described in the most recent version of “General guidelines for SSC CDM methodologies”. If the remaining lifetime of the affected systems increases due to the project activity, the crediting period shall be limited to the estimated remaining lifetime, i.e. the time when the affected systems would have been replaced in the absence of the project activity. 
1. In cases where product output (e.g. hot/fused metal) cannot be measured, the input material used in the manufacturing process can be used as a proxy for determining baseline/project emissions. 
1. Measures are limited to those that result in emission reductions of less than or equal to 60 kt CO2 equivalent annually. 
1. The methodology shall be included in the Gold Standard’s list of approved methodologies.
# 3 Additionality
According to the Procedures and Requirements Version 2, CDM Tool 21 (Version 13.1) may be used to determine additionality for small scale project activities.

Project participants shall provide an explanation to show that the project activity would not have occurred anyway due to at least one of the following barriers: 

(a) Investment barrier: a financially more viable alternative to the project activity would have led to higher emissions; 

(b) Technological barrier: a less technologically advanced alternative to the project activity involves lower risks due to the performance uncertainty or low market share of the new technology adopted for the project activity and so would have led to higher emissions; 

(c) Barrier due to prevailing practice: prevailing practice or existing regulatory or policy requirements would have led to implementation of a technology with higher emissions; 

(d) Other barriers: without the project activity, for another specific reason identified by the project participant, such as institutional barriers or limited information, managerial resources, organizational capacity, financial resources, or capacity to absorb new technologies, emissions would have been higher. 
# 4 Baseline emissions calculation
The baseline emissions from displacement of fossil fuels are calculated as follows:

Where:

*BEy	=* The baseline emissions from the fossil fuels displaced by the project activity in t CO2e in year *y* (of the crediting period)

*FCPJ, k, y*	= Quantity of biomass type *k* used in the project plant in a year *y* (tonnes)

*NCV,k,y*	= Net calorific value of the biomass type *k* in  year *y* (GJ / tonne)

*FPy*		= Fuel penalty / bonus in year *y* (GJ)

*EF CO2, BL, y*	= Baseline emission factor in year *y* (t CO2/GJ). The parameter shall be estimate following paragraph 29 (equations 7 & 8 below).

|**Element**|**Value applied**|**Unit**|**Source**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|*BEy*|To calculate|t CO2e|Calculated ex-ante|
|*FCPJ, k, y*|To calculate|tonnes|Estimated ex-ante for PDD|
|*NCV,k,y*|0.0178|GJ / t|From KIRDI test|
|FPy|0|-|Not applicable|
|*EF CO2, BL, y*|0.10192|t CO2 / GJ|Calculated|

## 4.1 Fuel Penalty or Bonus
A project specific fuel “penalty” or fuel “bonus” may be applied because the combustion of biomass will affect the heat transfer efficiency in the manufacturing process. The project fuels may therefore require a greater or smaller heat input to produce the same quantity and quality of the process output.

This project specific fuel penalty/bonus (FPy) should be determined as follows:

Where: 

*Pprod, y*	 	= Production in year y (tonnes)

*SECprod, PJ, y*	= Specific energy consumption of the plant in year y (GJ/t product)

*SECprod, BL*	= Specific energy consumption of the plant in the absence of the project activity (GJ/t product)

The specific energy consumption in the project is calculated based on the quantity of all fuels used in the project plant and the quantity of output produced in year y, as follows: 

![Aspose Words 1ce3ec3c-d683-461d-80f4-5ab42b9f481f 004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107647878/199826510-613fcc02-bc90-46b9-b170-38d55348afbd.png)


Where:

*SECprod, PJ,y*	= Specific energy consumption of the project plant in year *y* (GJ/t output)

*FCPJ, I, y* 	= Quantity of fossil fuel type I fired in the project plant in year *y* (tonnes)

*NCVi,y*	= Net calorific value of the fossil fuel type *i* in year *y* (GJ/tonne)

*FCPJ, k, y*	= Quantity of the biomass type k used in the project plant in year *y* (tonnes)

*NCVk,y*	= Net calorific value of the biomass type k in year y (GJ/tonne)

*Pprod,y*		= Production in year y (tonnes)

This is carried out at a factory level.

As a conservative approach, the specific energy consumption in the absence of the project activity should be calculated as the lowest annual ratio of fuel input per output production among the most recent three years prior to the start date of the project activity, as follows: 

![Aspose Words 1ce3ec3c-d683-461d-80f4-5ab42b9f481f 005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107647878/199826533-fb867221-d088-4344-9821-5dc5dba04380.png)


Where:

*SECprod, BL*	= Specific energy consumption of the project plant in the absence of the project activity (GJ/t output) 

*FC,i,x*	= Quantity of fossil fuel type *i* used in the project plant in year *x* (tonnes) 

*NCV,i*	= Net calorific value of the fossil fuel type i (GJ/tonne) 

*Pprod,x*	= Production in year x (tonnes) 

*x*	= Year prior to the start of the project activity 

*I*	= Fossil fuel types used in the project plant in the last three years prior to the start date of the project activity

This is carried out at a factory level.
## 4.2 Baseline Emission Factor Calculation
In cases where project activity involves partial fossil fuel switch to biomass, the baseline emissions factor (EF CO2, BL, y) shall be calculated as the minimum of the ex-ante emission factor (EF CO2, BL, (ex-ante)) and ex post emission factor (EF CO2, BL, y (ex-post)) determined as per equations 7 and 8. 

The weighted average annual CO2 emission factor of the fossil fuel(s) that are used in the project plant in year y, calculated as follows: 

![Aspose Words 1ce3ec3c-d683-461d-80f4-5ab42b9f481f 006](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107647878/199826559-1edcf01b-be3d-48b1-b8b9-ab31599cb77f.png)

Where:

*EFCO2, BL, (ex-ante)* 	= Ex ante emissions factor for the fossil fuels displaced in year y (t CO2/GJ)

*FCi,x*			= Quantity of fossil fuel type *i* use in the plant in year x

|**Element**|**Value applied**|**Unit**|**Source**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|*EFCO2, BL, (ex-ante)*|QQQQ|t CO2/TJ|Calculated ex ante|
|*FCi,x*|X|t|Factory records 2020-21|
|*FCi,x-1*|Y|t|Factory records 2019-20|
|*FCi,x-2*|Z|t|Factory records 2018-19|
|*EFCo2,FF,i*|0.10192|t CO2/TJ|IPCC 2006|
|*NCVi*|0.0156|TJ/tonne|IPCC default value|

![Aspose Words 1ce3ec3c-d683-461d-80f4-5ab42b9f481f 007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107647878/199826580-e3d76e74-bbd3-41f5-a6b3-7a44afde8562.png)


Where:

*EF CO2, BL, y (ex-post)*	= Ex-post emissions factor for the fossil fuels displaced in year y (t CO2/GJ) 

*EF CO2, FF, i, y*	= Carbon dioxide emission factor for fossil fuel type i in year *y* (t CO2/GJ) 

*FCPJ, I, y	=* Quantity of fuel type *i* fired in the project plant in year *y* (tonnes) 

|**Element**|**Value applied**|**Unit**|**Source**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|*EFCO2, BL, (ex-post)*|RRRR|t CO2/TJ|Calculated|
|*FCPJ,i,x*|X|t|Estimated ex-post number|
|NCVi,y|0.0156|TJ/tonne|IPCC default value|
|*EF CO2, FF, i, y*|112|t CO2/TJ|IPCC 2006|

For the determination of the emission factor (EF CO2,FF,i) and the net calorific value (NCV FF,i) for the fossil fuel (non-renewable biomass) used in the baseline scenario, guidance by the most recent version of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories shall be followed. 

In an amendment of the Methodology for the Gold Standard, the figures for:

- EF CO2, FF, i, y 
- EFCO2, BL, (ex-ante)
- EFCO2, BL, (ex-post)

will then each be multiplied by fNRB.

As only one fossil fuel (non-renewable biomass) is used in both the ex-ante and the ex-post scenario, both EFCO2, BL, (ex-ante) and EF CO2, BL, y (ex-post) will be the same.
# 5 Leakage
As per the methodology, general guidance on leakage in biomass project activities shall be followed to quantify leakages pertaining to the use of biomass residues. This is to be found in CDM Tool 16: Leakage from Biomass Activities Version 5.0, Section 6.

Paragraph 6.2 relates to leakage due to diversion of biomass residues from other applications in year y (LEBR,Div,y). This section is applicable for project activities which utilise biomass residues. It quantifies leakage due to diversion of biomass residues to the project to be used as either fuel or feedstock. These biomass residues could have been used outside the project boundary in competing applications, and due to the implementation of the project activity, these competing applications might be forced to use inputs which are not carbon neutral.

Where:

*PEy* 		= Project emissions in year *y* (tCO2)

*PEelec,y*		= Project emissions due to electricity consumption in year *y* (tCO2)

*PEfossifuel,y*	= Project emissions due to fossil fuel consumption in year (tCO2)

*PEtransport,y*	= Project emissions from transportation of the renewable biomass from the place of their origin to the manufacturing site in year *y* (tCO2)

*PEcultivation,y*	= Project emissions due to the cultivation of renewable biomass in year *y* (tCO2)

*PECH4,y* 	= Project emissions due to the production of charcoal in kilns not equipped with a methane recovery and destruction facility in year *y* (t CO2e)
