## Tolam Earth Non-Digital General Guardian Policy

**Introduction**: 

In order to increase trust in supply of quality offsets, it is ideal that a Project originate and conclude its Activity within secure, traceable technology such as blockchain. The Tolam Earth Marketplace can not assume that all potential sellers of offsets will have worked with Registries that leverage this technology. This Guardian Policy seeks to initiate a transparent and immutable digital path for offset projects which do not yet utilize the Hedera blockchain.

This Guardian Policy is a general policy which accepts multiple project types and which allows for entering the accepted Standard under which a project may have been developed. The associated Token that offsets are minted under is a Tolam Non-Digital (TND) Token. By default this policy will mint NFT to the account ID entered into the Issue Request or Claim.

**Scope and Applicability**: 

This Guardian Policy addresses carbon offset projects that originate outside of the Hedera Ecological ecosystem, and from which claims will be tracked or exchanged within the Hedera ecosystem.

This Guardian Policy should not be used for Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) projects due to the risk of non permanence.
