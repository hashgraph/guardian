## GHG Assessment Guideline Soil MRV

This MRV is based upon the work by GHG protocol

> For an accurate carbon measurements the document should be used in tandem with a scientific verifier has access to a methodology to verify the submitted data

The measurements uses these fields below:

- Annual change in carbon stocks
- SOC0 = soilorganic carbon stock in the last year
- SOC (0-T) = soil organic carbon stock at the beginning of the inventory time period, tonnes C ha-1
- Number of years over a single inventory time period, yr.
- Time dependence of stock change factors which is the default time period for transition between equilibrium SOC values, yr. Commonly 20 years, but depends on assumptions made in computing the factors FLU, FMG and FI. If T exceeds D, use the value for T to obtain an annual rate of change over the inventory time period (0-T years).
- Represents the climate zones, sthe soil types, and ithe set of management systems that are present in a country.
- The reference carbon stock, tonnes C ha-1
- Stock change factor for land-use systems or sub-system for a particular land-use, dimensionless
- Stock change factor for management regime, dimensionless
- Stock change factor for input of organic matter, dimensionless
- Land area of the stratum being estimated, ha.

Furthermore, it is based on multiple soil measurements for a given plot of land.

An example of soil sample measurements.

- Name of Area
- Name of Strata
- Plot number
- GPS location
- Date of extraction
- Sample depth (layer)
- Name of the person in charge
