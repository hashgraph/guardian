> For an accurate carbon measurements the document should be used in tandem with a scientific verifier has access to a methodology to verify the submitted data

It uses these fields below:

- Monthly Rainfall
- Monthly Open pan evaporation
- Average Monthly mean air temperature
- Clay content of the soil
- Estimate of decomposability
- Soil Cover (0 or 1)
