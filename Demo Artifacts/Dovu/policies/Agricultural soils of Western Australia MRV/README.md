> For an accurate carbon measurements the document should be used in tandem with a scientific verifier has access to a methodology to convert the above data into a number.

It uses these fields below:

- Soil Depth
- Container Radius
- Soil Volume
- Dry Soil Weight
- Bulk Density
- Carbon value
- SOC per Ha
- Carbon Estimate Total

Further accurate measurements can also be taken by referencing gravel bulk density in the following link
