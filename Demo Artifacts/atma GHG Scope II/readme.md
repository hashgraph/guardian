# atma GHG Scope II  Carbon Emission Policy 

### Process Overview 

![](ProcessOverview.png)

## Process description 

This policy supports the calculation of carbon emission during the production lifecycle stage for one single product based on the measured energy consumption during production at the manufacturing site. 

The calculated GHG emission values are aggregated on a monthly basis and carbon emission token is minted at the end of each month. 

Emissions calculated: (based on local emissions factors)

* CO2
* N2O
* CH4
* CO2e 

## Limitations

Currently only a single product type is supported per policy instance, however it is possible to instantiate the policy multiple times in order to support multiple different products.
