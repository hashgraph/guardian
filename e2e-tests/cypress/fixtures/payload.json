Through the restoration of at least 7,000 ha of mangroves, the project aims to:\n\n- Strengthen the vegetation cover in the mangrove ecosystems.\n- Improve natural resources production and income of vulnerable community groups.\n- Strengthen the capacity of vulnerable groups to use land resources sustainably.\n- Strengthen biodiversity and its habitat.\n\nThe project's reforestation sites are bare land in the baseline scenario, and the mudflat has remained untouched for more than 10 years. These sites do not contain any vegetation and are not used by local people or animals. Carbon dioxide removals are expected to be generated by direct planting of different native species of mangroves. The plantation will be done with a tree density of up to 5,500 trees per hectare and there will be regular monitoring activities. At the end of the crediting period of 40 years, the net emissions reductions are expected to be up to 2,861,923 tCO2e (71,548 tCO2e annually)\n\nThe restoration of the degraded mangrove ecosystems is essential for adapting Senegal's coastline to climate change. The diverse structure of mangrove roots and their unique position between land and sea make them vital habitats for numerous species. Moreover, they play a crucial role in enhancing water quality and nutrient transfer to surrounding ecosystems, at the same time they protect coastal areas from erosion and extreme events. By filtering and trapping sediment from runoff and river water, mangroves reduce water turbidity and ensure that essential light reaches the deep topsoil. Thus, protecting and restoring mangrove formations is the primary objective of the grouped project, aiming to generate positive impacts on the local climate, communities, and biodiversity.\n\nEngaging local communities from the outset stands as a cornerstone of the project. This involves disseminating information on all project activities and imparting fundamental knowledge on climate change and carbon sequestration initiatives. The project advocates for an inclusive family model where both women and men have equal opportunities for participation. Community members will be introduced to alternative livelihood options, such as cultivating high-value crops, beekeeping, or exploring ecotourism, among other opportunities, which will alleviate pressure on mangrove forests. Additionally, the project aims to enhance basic infrastructure in rural communities.\n\nThere is no jurisdictional REDD+ in Senegal, so, the project is not located within any jurisdiction.",

The implementation schedule is described in section 2.1.19 (Implementation Schedule).\n\nMangroves sequester carbon both in their biomass and in the soil.

      "G186": "The ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project is located in the Sine Saloum Delta and the Casamance Estuary. This area encompasses three regions (Fatick, Sedhiou, and Ziguinchor), 6 departments and 24 municipalities. The country is covered by three different biomes: Sahelian savannas (covering a small area in the northern part of the country), Western Sudanese dry savannas and Clear forests, and Guinean savannas (Taibi et al., 2023). The Delta and Estuary where the project is located are covered by the last two biomes.\n\n#### **Topography**\n\nSenegal, occupying an area of 196,722 km², has a generally low topography, with plains and low plateaux rarely exceeding 130 m of altitude and with three main rivers crossing the country: Senegal River, Gambia River, and the Casamance River (UN, n.d.).\n\nThe Sine Saloum Delta covers approximately 2,500 km² and presents a series of sandy bays, multiple islands and estuaries covered by a rich mangrove ecosystem (Hardy et al., 2016). On the other hand, the Casamance Estuary has 0 meters of altitude. After reaching its peak elevation of 75 meters, the Casamance River gradually descends over its 400-kilometer course, eventually reaching sea level at the Casamance Estuary. The most significant decrease in altitude occurs in the final 200 kilometers of its journey, where it transitions from its highest point to an altitude of 0 meters (Kantoussan, 2012).\n\nThe landscape in the Sine Saloum Delta is characterized not only by unique ecosystems such as mangroves but also by important geological formations such as dunes. It is also characterized by the presence of hundreds of archaeological shell mounds. These mounds, waste products of past human shell fishing and processing, are evidence of a millennial activity that is still practiced by Serer Niominka people living in the Saloum Delta (Carré et al., 2022). In the case of the Casamance delta, salt marshes are characteristic and best developed in the medium part of the estuary. In these areas and the high ones, mangroves and tannes are bordered by low terraces about 1 m above sea level with sandy or clayey soils (Niang-Diop, 2002).\n\n#### **Soil**\n\n#### a. Sine Saloum Delta\n\nIn this area, marine dynamics have long played a crucial role in shaping the region's geomorphological and pedological features, leading notably to the prevalence of distinctive soil types such as holomorphic soils, known locally as \"tans,\" hydromorphic and ferruginous soils (Diop et al., 2023).\n\nThe holomorphic soils, covering approximately 140,000 hectares of the Sine Saloum watershed, are typically found immediately behind the mangrove areas. Meanwhile, the hydromorphic soils, characterized as saline acid sulphate soils, are closely associated with the mangroves and are situated within the tidal mudflats of the tidal and intertidal zones, which are submerged daily by the tides.\n\nWithin the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve, mangroves cover approximately 300 hectares, constituting around 25% of the reserve's total area. The estuarine soils predominantly range from sandy to clayey compositions. According to SADIO (1991), the mangrove soils in the Saloum region are mudflats resulting from clay sediments deposited around watercourses within the intertidal zone.\n\nb. Casamance Estuary\n\nIn Casamance Estuary, mangrove soils are recent and current fluvio-marine deposits which occupy the middle and lower parts of the valleys (MDRH, 1980). These are most often acidic sulfate soils, rich in organic matter and salty.\n\nThese results confirm that the soil in the project area is mineral soil, with more than 60% made of sand. These results are supported by the information obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database (v2.0), which was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) together with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and other recognized organizations such as the Soil Reference and Information Center (ISRIC).\n\n#### **Climate**\n\nSenegal is characterized by the Sudano-Sahelian climate, which has two distinct seasons: a dry one that lasts from November to May, and a rainy season from June to October. The mean annual temperature in the country is 28ºC, with monthly averages in the hottest seasons of up to 35°C. Regarding the amount of rainfall, the southern part of the country receives more rainfall (1,000 – 1,500 mm/year) than the north (300 – 350 mm/year) (Ahmed et al., 2021).\n\nThe Sine Saloum Delta, where part of the project is located, straddles hot semiarid and dry tropical savanna climate types. The mean annual temperature ranges from 27.2 to 30ºC, total annual rainfall is 450–920 mm. The climate is characterized by a long dry season from November to June, followed by a short and wet season from July to October (Devaney, Marone & McElwain, 2021).\n\nOn the other hand, the Casamance River, where the rest of the areas are distributed, has a sudanoguinean climate, characterized by the alternation of two seasons: a wet season from mid-May to mid-September and a dry season during the rest of the year. The mean annual precipitation reaches 1,300 mm/year and the mean annual temperature is 27ºC (Kantoussan, 2012; Bassene, 2013).\n\n#### **Hydrology**\n\nSenegal possesses abundant freshwater resources, though their availability fluctuates significantly across seasons and regions, a trend expected to intensify with the onset of climate change, particularly in terms of more severe and prolonged droughts. The rivers feed important deltas and estuaries such as the Sine Saloum Delta and the Casamance Estuary, where the project is located (USAID, 2021).\n\nThe country is divided in five main drainage basins (the Senegal River, Gambia River, Casamance River, the Kayanga River, and the Sine Saloum), and all of them flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The biggest one is the Senegal River basin, which contributes 20,000 million cubic meters annually and has different protected sites by Ramsar (Convention of Wetlands) (USAID, 2021).\n\nThe Sine Saloum Delta, located 100 km south of Dakar, is made up of a string of low islands separated by inlets called bolongs, and it is characteristic due to the mangrove formations present in the area (Simier et al., 2004). On the right bank, the Saloum River bends southward at its mouth due to a narrow barrier beach, where it is possible to find the villages of Palmarin and Djiffer. Across from Djiffer, on the left bank, are the twin islands housing the villages of Dionewar and Niodior. These islands were once protected by the barrier beach but are now exposed to the ocean. Unlike typical estuaries where salinity decreases upstream, salinity increases in this delta. This is because evaporation outweighs freshwater inflow, especially with shifting rainfall patterns reducing water flow from upstream (Simier et al., 2004; Ecoutin et al., 2010).\n\nOn the other hand, the Casamance Estuary is characterized by a vast hydrographic network of water bodies, covering different vegetation formations such as woodlands, wetlands, and mangrove swamps. These mangrove ecosystems play a crucial role in erosion prevention while also serving as vital habitats for numerous species and as a source of natural resources for local communities (Sadio et al., 2023). As in the Sine Saloum Delta, the Casamance Estuary is characterized because of having inverse salinity, and therefore the water is salty for the most part of the year (9 months) (Descroix et al., 2020).\n\nRight now, these unique coastal areas are affected by rising sea levels, coastal erosion, pollution, and other impacts (USAID, 2021).\n\n#### **Types of vegetation (providing, at minimum, estimates of the area of land under different management types).**\n\nSenegal has different vegetation types throughout the country: Forests in the south, Savanna in the center, and Steppe in the north. Some parts of the coast, such as the one where the project is located, are covered by a very special vegetation type: mangroves (UN, n.d.; NASA, 2018).\n\nIn the country, it is possible to find seven species of mangroves: *Acrostichum aureum*, *Rhizophora mangle*, *Rhizophora racemose*, *Rhizophora harisonnii*, *Laguncularia racemose, Avicennia Africana, and Conocarpus erectus* (Gallup, Sonnenfeld & Dahdouh-Guebas, 2020). In the Sine-Saloum Delta, it is guaranteed to find all of them but *Acrostichum aureum* (Gallup, Sonnenfeld & Dahdouh-Guebas, 2020). In the case of the Casamance Estuary, the main mangrove species are *Rhizophora racemosa* and *Avicennia africana* (FAO, UNEP, 1981).\n\nIn Senegal, fluctuating tidal patterns and increased salinity levels due to climate change have adversely impacted mangrove species, particularly *Rhizophora* and *Avicennia*, inhibiting their reproduction and survival. Despite an expansion in mangrove areas since the mid-1990s and a subsequent decrease in salinity levels with rainfall recovery, Senegalese hydrological systems exhibit complex responses to climate fluctuations. The Saloum estuary remains an inverse system even during the rainy season, while Casamance experiences salinity changes from upstream freshwater inflows (Lomard & Andrieu, 2021).\n\nIn the Sine Saloum Delta, at the upper limit of the tidal influence, the halophytic meadows, there are \"grassy tannas\" (as opposed to lively tans, over-salted areas without vegetation). The area of the Sine Saloum Delta and its tributaries, more precisely in the districts of Fimela, Niodior, Djilor, and Toubacouta, is the domain of the tannas and mangroves. There are coastal mangroves (*Rhizophora racemosa* and *Rhizophora mangle*; *Avicennia africana*), herbaceous formations along the watercourses, and tree steppes (generally roasted trees) on the hillsides. The upstream areas are occupied by halophytic grasses and *Tamarix senegalensis*. The total mangrove area in the Delta is approximately 58,000 ha. It is estimated that around 25% of this area is made up of high mangroves (*Rhizophora*) and 75% of low mangroves (*Avicennia*).\n\nIn Casamance, the floodable areas are colonized upstream by reedbeds and downstream by mangroves. The main groups of vegetation are stands of oil palm (*Elaeis guineensis*), bamboo (*Oxythenantera abyssinica*) and roan (Borassus aethiopium): Ndimb (Cordyla pinnata), Kapokier (*Bombax costatum*), Néré (*Parkia biglobosa*), Santan (*Daniellia oliveri*), Vène (*Pterocarpus erinaceus*), Cailcédrat (*Khaya senegalensis*), Fromager (*Ceiba pentandra*), Ditakh (*Detarium senegalensis*). The Casamance mangrove is floristically richer and denser than the mangroves of the Saloum estuary and the Senegal River. It is made up of Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora harissonii and Rhizophora, mangle for the Rhizophora genus, *Avicennia nitida* or *africana*, *Laguncularia racemosa* and *Conocarpus erectus*, all Combretaceae.\n\nPsycho-chemical parameters:\n\nThe Sine Saloum Delta and Casamance Estuary are known because of their reverse salinity. In regard to the Casamance Estuary, salinity values have an average of 43.77 g/L in 2018 (Descroix et al., 2020) while the Sine Saloum Delta has average values of 48.5g/L in some studies (Kantoussan et al., 2012). As different values can be found in bibliography, water samples are being taken since 2023.\n\nIn regard to the pH, the Saloum River shows values that go between 7.8 during the dry season and 8.3 during the wet season (Dieng et al., 2017), while the Casamance River has values of around 7.3 pH (Pagès, Lemoalle & Fritz, 1995). In Saloum, the temperature values reach a temperature that ranges between 28 and 30ºC (Dieng et al., 2017), while in Casamance the average annual temperature reaches 25ºC (Debenay, Pages & Diouf, 1989). In both areas, these values are close to the air temperature.\n\nIn general, salinization, nitrate pollution, agricultural runoff and other factors are modifying the psychochemical characteristics of coastal areas in Senegal (USAID, 2021).",
      "G187": "Senegal, with a population of 18,032,473 inhabitants, exhibits a predominantly youthful demographic, with half of its residents under the age of 19. Most of the population resides in the Dakar axis, with the northern and eastern regions being the least densely populated. Approximately 46.5% of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihood (ANSD, 2023). Regarding the religion, most of the country citizens (more than 90%) are Muslims, while the rest are mostly Christians (Koter, 2021).\n\nThe ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project operates in two administrative regions, Fatick and Ziguinchor, occupied by the most important mangrove landscapes in Senegal: The Sine Saloum delta and the Casamance Estuary.\n\n- *1.* **Ziguinchor region**: The project areas located in the Casamance Estuary are located within this region, which is home of 612,343 people (ANSD, 2023). With its wealth in forest resources, agricultural production, livestock breeding and tourism, Ziguinchor has a strong economic potential (Sonko & Deak, 2020). Both economically and socially, the fishing sector plays a major role in the region, although livestock activities are also important in the area. It features an extensive coastline stretching 85 kilometres, accompanied by a vast hydrographic network, including a 300-kilometer-long axial river intertwined with numerous bolongs. This rich aquatic environment fosters abundant fisheries resources and supports the growth of maritime, lagoon, and river fishing activities (Bledé, Compaoré & Diouf, 2015). Positioned strategically, the Ziguinchor region serves as a pivotal centre for sub-regional trade. Orchards flourish here, yielding diverse fruit resources like papaya, mangoes, and citrus fruits, alongside a bounty of agricultural produce ranging from honey and ginger to monkey bread and palm oil (Deidhiou, 2014). In addition, there are abundant fishery resources (oysters, shrimps and fish) as well as other agricultural products such as cashew nuts and peanuts (Diedhiou, 2019).\n- 2. **Fatick region**: The rest of the areas of the ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project are in this region, in the Sine Saloum Delta. The region, with a population of 908,858 inhabitants, shares a common trait with many inland areas of the country: it tends to have low activity levels. Additionally, it faces increased difficulty in agricultural production due to the challenges posed by climate change (Habanabakize, 2022; ANSD, 2023). The main activities are agriculture (employing more than 90% of the working population) and livestock (practised by 70% of the population). Unfortunately, this region is one of the poorest ones in the country due to factors such as difficult access to water, prolonged droughts and reduction of pastoral areas due to salinization (Habanabakize, 2022).\n\nThe Sine Saloum Delta provides livelihoods for more than 100,000 inhabitants (Delta, 2020). The residents around the project area predominantly include smallholders, fishermen, and independent farmers, who primarily cultivate family-owned lands, especially rice fields. Their main income stems from marketing perennial crops such as fruits, fish products, and rice. These products are grown on small, subdivided plots of land where livestock is also raised, usually to support farming activities or for personal consumption. Additionally, many practice home horticulture to supplement their daily dietary needs (UNESCO, 2012; Power, 2016).\n\nIn the different areas, it is possible to find GIEs (Economic Interest Grouping) and cooperatives, which are important forms of community economic organization, and they are often confronted with problems of access to finance. Composed mainly of women, the MSEs are involved in the collection, processing, and marketing of non-timber forest products as well as fisheries resources from the mangrove (Périlleux & Szafarz, 2015).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that mangroves are the object of many political, economic, and social issues, as their multiple values lead to the emergence of competition for different uses such as agricultural, aquacultural, or touristic. Conflicts between actors arise due to these ecosystems. Sedentary peasantfishermen consider the mangrove as part of their land, while migrant users, foreign entrepreneurs, and hotel complex promoters only see it as a pioneering front. Finally, scientists and politicians concerned with environmental protection and the preservation of biodiversity tend to make the mangrove a nature reserve (Cormier-Salem, 2006; Fent et al., 2019).\n\nRegarding education, the population has a high percentage of literacy, and this is very similar among men and women. The sites have educational establishments at primary and secondary levels, as well as universities such as the Assane Seck University in Ziguinchor and the El Hadj Ibrahima Niass University in Sine Saloum. The level of education most often achieved is complete primary education. Although the new generations attend secondary schools with a high completion rate, there are some cases of drop-out. The reasons for this are teenage pregnancy and the need for employment in the family. However, there is a higher literacy rate among girls. This is due to the results of the sensibilization on enrolling girls in school.\n\nIn the early childhood sub-sector, there were 157 establishments in 2019, 107 of which were located in the departmental capital of Fatick (68.2%). The department of Foundiougne had 38 childcare facilities. In terms of early childhood establishments, there were 360 staff, 270 of whom were located in Fatick and 90 in Foundiougne. In addition, most of the staff have a school-leaving certificate (brevet de fin d'études moyennes), i.e. 232 out of 397 people (58% of the total workforce). There are 10,309 pre-school children in the project area, 52.3% of them girls (SES Fatick, 2019).\n\nIn terms of middle and secondary education, there were 145 facilities in the departments in the project area, including 98 in the department of Fatick and 57 in the department of Foundiougne. There were 2,748 middle and secondary school teachers in the region in 2019. The average number of teachers per school was 25. Finally, the number of pupils was 68,588, 53% of whom were girls. The main constraints are as follows:\n\n- Lack of training for teaching and administrative staff.\n- Lack of pre-school infrastructure.\n- The plethora of temporary shelters at elementary and middle school levels.\n- The lack of logistical resources on the part of the education authorities.\n\nIn the project intervention areas, there is religious (Muslims, Catholics, and Animists), cultural, and ethnic diversity (groups such as Serer, Djola, Wolof, Balante, and Mandingo). Despite this diversity, they share the same lifestyle, type of occupation and income scale as well as access to public education and health systems. This is due to the inter-religious dialogue that has existed for centuries. In the past, these communities were characterized by the development of a way of life linked to the forest, materially, socially, and cosmologically. Today, their traditional living conditions have been greatly modified by colonial and private advances on their ancestral territories, which have not only created a series of obstacles to the development of their traditional life but also the loss of part of their source of subsistence with the restrictions related to the conservation of the areas.\n\nRegarding the social parameters, it is important to mention that Senegal is affected with the departure of many migrants illegally. The two coastal regions where the project is located constitute strong departure areas for illegal emigration (Mbaye, 2014; Ngom, 2022).",
      "G188": "As it has been mentioned in previous sections, the project is located in the Sine Saloum delta and the Casamance Estuary, in the municipalities detailed in the following table (Table 4):\n\nThe project area is located in three regions, six departments, and 24 municipalities and it can be extended to more municipalities. The populations of the municipalities concerned will be considered as beneficiaries and/or impacted stakeholders.\n\nThe images below describe the boundaries of the project areas:\n\nThe project started with direct planting activities in different areas. In 2022, approximately 1,100 hectares where planted, while in 2023 approximately 2,100 hectares were planted. The total target is 7,000 ha.

      "G191": "<p>The project's overarching objective is to reverse degradation trends and restore at least 7,000 hectares of degraded mangroves in Senegal, thereby revitalizing valuable ecosystems and enhancing productivity. This effort contributes to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting the coastline of Senegal to climate change, thus mitigation and adaptation benefits. In addition, the project focuses on having a positive impact on local communities' well-being and biodiversity providing several important benefits for surrounding habitats contributing to water quality and nutrient transfer (for more information, see section 2.1.1. Summary Description of the project). The degradation of the mangrove has been happening since the last 20 years due to climate change and illegal logging. Therefore, the theory of change of the project is focused on restoring the degraded mangrove through the planting of native species by promoting and developing a model of forest management and sustainable rural development in the territory, which contributes to the improvement of the living conditions of the project partners and the local communities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this long-term objective, three main scopes of work have been defined:</p><ul><li>Control of deforestation and illegal logging&nbsp;</li><li>Empowerment of the communities&nbsp;</li><li>Sustainable use of natural resources through the implementation of productive alternative activities</li></ul><p>This will be achieved through training, capacity building and introducing alternative livelihood that supplements the illegal activities that cause the degradation of the mangrove.

The community-based approach ensures that the reforestation efforts will sustainable, culturally relevant, and beneficial to the people who depend on mangroves for their livelihoods. This has been structured in four main activities described as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>1.1.Community Engagement and Mobilization</u>: Engage with local communities, including elders, fishermen, women’s groups, and youth, to discuss the importance of mangroves, understand local needs, and gather input on the reforestation project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This activity focused on two main scopes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Identification and engagement of the NGOs capable for planting.

Prospection and selection of eligible areas: </u>The prospection and selection of the areas is to be performed considering factors such as tidal patterns, soil salinity, and community access, but integrating traditional knowledge and practices into the reforestation process, ensuring that cultural practices are respected and utilized to enhance the success of the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first scrutiny of areas is crosschecked with carbon requirements regarding the situation of the forest in the last ten years. Mapping all mangrove sites using GPS and computing the total size of selected areas will be done. To achieve these objectives, Technical Services of Marine Protected Areas and the community members who are living adjacent to the mangrove and have an intimate knowledge of the areas to be mapped were involved in executing the plan. During the entire exercise, a GIS expert was working in the team picking the coordinates using a GPS for areas that were seen to have been degraded. With the assistance of ArcGIS software, the surveyor was able to plot the sites into the maps identifying areas that had been degraded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The team, adding local knowledge provided by the community members identified sites suitable for reforestation and restoration. They also assessed the information on the historical knowledge available amongst the older members of the community, who confirmed that these areas were previously covered by mangroves but were overharvested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>1.3. Reforestation campaign workshop launch</u>: Launching a reforestation campaign workshop is the event to establish and organize the entire reforestation project. It serves as a platform to engage stakeholders, raise awareness, and provide essential training and information. Objectives of these workshops are educating participants on the importance of reforestation, providing hands-on training, and fostering community ownership of the project. During that event, the contracts with the partners are signed for each planting cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>1.4. Planting activities</u>: The overall objective of the project is to reinforce the mangrove cover rate by the restoration of the mangrove ecosystem, regenerating the native forest structure, reinserting native species, and restoring biodiversity. The native species considered are Rhizophora mangle (Pasiec, 2015), Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora harisonnii (Norman &amp; James, 2006). Avicennia germinans (Devaney, Marone, &amp; McElwain, 2021) will also be a potential species to be planted in future instances if success experiences are achieved in plant propagation through nurseries. The bare land will be replanted considering the density and distribution of the species that will promote the interaction between them for the sustainable recovery of the forest and will also promote the reinsertion of fauna specimens, naturally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>1.5. Follow up:</u> The follow up activities are critical to monitor the growth and health of the planted areas. The community will provide feedback on the project, allowing for adaptive management and continuous improvement of the reforestation efforts. The progress is shared an with the community increasing the transparency of the project helping to maintain trust and encourages ongoing participation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Objective 2: Training and education for the improvement of the individual, collective and organizational capacities</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Training and awareness-raising of local communities involved in the project is one of the most important steps in the process. Thus, community members will be trained in basic concepts of climate change (mitigation, adaptation, and resilience) and management of an area reserved for the carbon project, including information on alternative livelihood options. Most community members already have experience planting mangroves, so the training is designed to improve those skills rather than starting from scratch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This phase also involves the organization of teams, headquarters, field bases, means of transport, and all the necessary logistics implementation to develop the project including the Health and Safety program. Two main activities will be developed:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>2.1. Design of a general Capacity Building Program</u>: The program is being designed to be participatory, context-specific, and focused on long-term sustainability. Local knowledge will be integrated in the different modules, providing practical training. Four scopes are previously defined and will be adapted during the crediting period to the needs of the communities:</p><ul><li>Technical activities on forestry and monitoring&nbsp;</li><li>Environmental and social awareness&nbsp;</li><li>Health and Safety&nbsp;</li><li>Productive and alternative projects</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>2.2. Creation of a learning community through learning routes and experiential encounters with different members of the community</u>: The aim is to create a collaborative environment where community members actively engage in shared learning experiences to strengthens social bonds and empowers individuals to apply what they learn in real-life situations. This will be obtained through three activities:</p><ul><li>Systematization of the learning process through materials adapted to the communities (guidelines, fact sheets, videos, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Training of trainers to create a pool of teachers for the communities&nbsp;</li><li>Creation of specific gender training</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Objective 3. Promote an economy based on sustainable productive projects</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reinvest the income from the carbon credits in the communities, a Socioeconomic and environmental impact analysis is used to carefully tailor the Benefit Sharing Mechanism adapted to the needs of the project. The following activities are designed:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>3.1. Identify, formulate and implement productive projects: </u>ALLCOT will quantify the impact of the ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project in the SDGs with the final aim of maximizing co-benefits and addressing trade-offs. The objectives of that analysis are:</p><ul><li>Facilitate the decision-making process with transparent information.&nbsp;</li><li>Focus on the real needs of the communities.&nbsp;</li><li>Increase comparability and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Identify the real value of the project.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>3.2. Identify, formulate and implement a manual of good practices in the sectors defined by the BSM: </u>This activity will result in documented material in local language for implementing good environmental practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>3.3. 3. Formulate a technical assistance program for each productive project. </u>The technical assistance program will be adapted to each of the productive project to be defined through the Benefit Sharing mechanism of the project. The steering committee is responsible for managing the implementation of the productive projects defined by the communities and should serve as a collaborative platform to guide and oversee the implementation of the benefit-sharing mechanism. It should foster inclusive decisionmaking, transparency, and accountability to ensure the equitable distribution of benefits and the long-term success of the mangrove restoration project. Some options and ideas for productive projects already proposed by communities are:</p><ul><li>Capacity building in areas as leadership, climate change, finances, or forestry-specific activities.&nbsp;</li><li>Sustainable fishing.&nbsp;</li><li>Ecotourism.&nbsp;</li><li>Beekeeping.&nbsp;</li><li>Technical training: drone, inventories, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Biodiversity conservation programmes.&nbsp;</li><li>Women empowerment programme.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>3.3. Identify potential products and by-products associated with main production lines</u>: this activity is focused on the development of a portfolio of products and by-products depending on the productive project, among others, honey, oysters, fish, ecotourism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Theory of Change for this community-based mangrove restoration project envisions a holistic approach that integrates ecological restoration with community empowerment and sustainable livelihood development. By engaging local communities, building their capacity, and ensuring strong governance, the project aims to create a sustainable and resilient mangrove ecosystem that benefits both the environment and the people who depend on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The summary of the Theory of Change design document (4563/07) is showed in the Appendix 2.</p>",
      "G192": "Senegal has confirmed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in its own national development agenda. The activities are focused on having impacts on climate, community, and biodiversity by direct planting of mangrove native species. The project converges with the objectives in the following ones and its respective targets:\n\n1. **SDG 1 – No poverty**: During planting activities (first 4 years) more than 1,000 jobs are being created. Once the mangrove is healthy, it will support local economies by providing resources such as fish, honey and reducing the poverty of the communities involved. The SDG also aligns with target 1.5: \"By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters\". As it has been mentioned, mangroves are resilient ecosystems that protect the coast from erosion at the same time they provide natural resources.\n\n2. **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**: A healthy mangrove ecosystem will support fisheries and aquaculture, contributing to local food security and nutrition. This SDG aligns with targets such as target 2.4: \"By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality\". As it has been explained, mangroves provide natural resources such as fish, which contributes to local communities' food security.\n\n3. **SDG 4 Quality education**. One of the main pillars of the project is the empowerment of the communities through capacity-building programmes. The project developer ensures training for the people involved as well as equal opportunities for both men and women. To ensure the education's quality, these programmes and trainings are given by professionals of the sector, which is align with target 4.4: \"By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship\".\n\n4. **SDG 5 Gender equality**: The project activity will ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership during planting season, monitoring activities and through the implementation of BSM. The project proponent is against any form of discrimination and equal opportunities are offered for both men and women.\n\n5. **SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation**: Contributing to target 6.6 (\"By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes\"), the project area plays a key role in filtering and purifying water and maintaining the health of coastal and marine ecosystems.\n\n- a. Mangroves of the project area, once they are restored, act as natural filters, trapping sediments, pollutants, and nutrients from land runoff before they reach coastal waters and rivers.\n- b. Mangroves reduce the flow of excessive nutrients, preventing algal blooms and maintaining a healthier aquatic environment.\n- c. In Casamance and Sine-Saloum, where the balance between saltwater and freshwater is crucial for livelihoods, mangrove restoration helps maintain this balance by protecting coastal freshwater resources from salinization.\n- d. The mangroves of the project areas help in maintaining groundwater levels, which will have downstream benefits for drinking water supplies and agriculture.\n\n6. **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth**: During planting activities (first 4 years) more than 1,000 jobs are being created. Local communities will be also involved in the monitoring activities, performing not only the inventories of the trees, but also biodiversity monitoring. And finally, through the implementation of the BSM, alternative livelihoods will be created generating more secondary employment in the area.\n\n7. **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production**: Through the productive projects defined in the BSM, capacity building is forecasted to implement sustainable fishing, with the aim of reducing pressure on the ecosystem and ensure its long-term viability. Activities are aligned with target 12.2: \"By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources\".\n\n8. **SDG 13 – Climate Action**: Carbon removals due to the growth of the mangrove will contribute to mitigate climate change. Project activities exert a positive impact on coastal ecosystems by mitigating coastal erosion and preserving sediments and organic matter within the delta and estuary, where the project is being developed, strengthening resilience and adaptability (target 13.1). Project activities are focused on having positive impacts on climate, community and biodiversity. Education and awareness (target 13.3) on climate change are vital for the continuation of the project implementation to achieve its objectives.\n\n9. **SDG 14 – Life Below Water:** One of the main pillars of the project is the biodiversity conservation. Two threated species are identified living in the area and the project will positively impact on them. Furthermore, the project area is a critical habitat for a wide variety of marine and coastal species, supporting biodiversity and act as nurseries for many fish species, supporting sustainable fisheries and marine life. Therefore, it aligns with target 14.2 \"By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans\".\n\n10. **SDG 15 – Life on Land:** The project protects shorelines from erosion and improves water quality by filtering pollutants. It promotes the implementation of sustainable management practices (which goes in line with target 15.2) and ensures the conservation of different areas, reducing degradation of natural habitats (target 15.5).\n\n11. **SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals:** This project is being implemented through a partnership between an NGO, private companies and local authorities, which enhances the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, with the participation of different stakeholders (impact on targets 17.16 and 17.17)",

The community-based approach ensures that the reforestation efforts will sustainable, culturally relevant, and beneficial to the people who depend on mangroves for their livelihoods. This has been structured in four main activities described as follows:\n\n1.1. Community Engagement and Mobilization: Engage with local communities, including elders, fishermen, women's groups, and youth, to discuss the importance of mangroves, understand local needs, and gather input on the reforestation project.\n\n1.2. Prospection and selection of eligible areas: The prospection and selection of the areas is to be performed considering factors such as tidal patterns, soil salinity, and community access, but integrating traditional knowledge and practices into the reforestation process, ensuring that cultural practices are respected and utilized to enhance the success of the project.\n\n1.3. Reforestation campaign workshop launch: Launching a reforestation campaign workshop is the event to establish and organize the entire reforestation project. It serves as a platform to engage stakeholders, raise awareness, and provide essential training and information.\n\n1.4. Planting activities: The overall objective of the project is to reinforce the mangrove cover rate by the restoration of the mangrove ecosystem, regenerating the native forest structure, reinserting native species, and restoring biodiversity.\n\n1.5. Follow up: The follow up activities are critical to monitor the growth and health of the planted areas. The community will provide feedback on the project, allowing for adaptive management and continuous improvement of the reforestation efforts.\n\n**Objective 2: Training and education for the improvement of the individual, collective and organizational capacities**\n\nTraining and awareness-raising of local communities involved in the project is one of the most important steps in the process. Thus, community members will be trained in basic concepts of climate change (mitigation, adaptation, and resilience) and management of an area reserved for the carbon project, including information on alternative livelihood options.\n\n2.1. Design of a general Capacity Building Program: The program is being designed to be participatory, context-specific, and focused on long-term sustainability. Four scopes are previously defined:\n- Technical activities on forestry and monitoring\n- Environmental and social awareness\n- Health and Safety\n- Productive and alternative projects\n\n2.2. Creation of a learning community through learning routes and experiential encounters with different members of the community: The aim is to create a collaborative environment where community members actively engage in shared learning experiences.\n\n**Objective 3. Promote an economy based on sustainable productive projects**\n\nThe reinvest the income from the carbon credits in the communities, a Socioeconomic and environmental impact analysis is used to carefully tailor the Benefit Sharing Mechanism adapted to the needs of the project.\n\n3.1. Identify, formulate and implement productive projects: ALLCOT will quantify the impact of the ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project in the SDGs with the final aim of maximizing co-benefits and addressing trade-offs.\n\n3.2. Identify, formulate and implement a manual of good practices in the sectors defined by the BSM: This activity will result in documented material in local language for implementing good environmental practices.\n\n3.3. Formulate a technical assistance program for each productive project: The technical assistance program will be adapted to each of the productive project to be defined through the Benefit Sharing mechanism of the project.\n\n#### Monitoring Plan Implementation Milestones\n\nThe monitoring plan will be implemented for the whole project longevity with the following key parameters and frequencies:\n\n**Biodiversity Monitoring:**\n- Species Richness: Periodically and at least every 4 years\n- Habitat Recovery: At every verification event\n- Climate change adaptation benefits: At each verification event\n- Biodiversity conservation: At each verification event\n- Water quality (pH and salinity): At each verification event\n- Rate of recovery and mortality: Annual\n- Soil quality: Periodically\n\n**Technical Monitoring:**\n- Training in techniques for monitoring reforested sites, searching for propagules and reforestation techniques\n- Continuous monitoring of the plantations\n- Monitoring and patrolling of the project areas\n- Water quality monitoring\n- Hydrological changes monitoring\n\n#### Verification and Compliance Milestones\n\n- The non-permanence risk is calculated in accordance with the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool and will be reassessed in each verification process\n- The baseline will be reassessed every ten years in accordance with VCS Rules and Requirements\n- Buffer credits will be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account based upon the non-permanence risk report\n- Prior to each validation/verification event, the project proponent will communicate the relevant information\n- New project activity instances will be included in the monitoring report with sufficient technical, financial, geographic, and other relevant information\n- Activity-shifting, market leakage and ecological leakage assessments, where required, shall be undertaken and reassessed where new instances of the project activity are included in the project",

Moreover, positive impacts are expected to continue in communities and biodiversity. A variety of native mangrove species has been carefully chosen to restore the area to its original state as closely as possible.\n\nIn the project, stakeholders have been engaged from the outset to identify risks and needs, and to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project. Communities stand as the primary beneficiaries of the ecosystem services rendered by the project areas slated for reforestation in the initial phase. These services include enhanced vegetation that attracts marine life like fish and oysters while reducing salinity levels. The direct benefits arising from these ecosystem services serve as a longterm incentive for the preservation of mangroves and their associated climate, community, and biodiversity advantages. To ensure the continuation and enhancement of these benefits beyond the project's lifespan and to address any risks unrelated to permanence, specific measures have been devised and are currently being implemented:\n\n- **Institutionalization of the main project interventions:** The various project interventions such as protection and sustainable management of restored mangrove forests, coastal and marine biodiversity conservation, and various supportive socio-economic development activities will be fully institutionalized into regular and everyday functioning of relevant local authorities, which will continually remain engaged with the local communities.\n- **Capacity building and community engagement:** Capacity building and sustained engagement with local communities will enhance their understanding and proficiency regarding diverse coastal and marine resources, encompassing mangroves, fisheries, biodiversity, and other natural assets.\n- **Diversification and increase local communities' income:** The project interventions will foster sustained, diversified, and augmented income streams for diverse socio-economic groups, ensuring continued benefits beyond the project's lifetime.\n- **Employment and business opportunities:** The objective of the Benefit Sharing Mechanism is to foster socio-economic development, environmental rehabilitation, and the cultivation of social capital through the empowerment of informed and skilled communities. This will create ample and diverse employment and business opportunities within the project area.\n- **Increase resilience**: Local communities have been entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding mangroves and promoting biodiversity conservation, alongside practicing sustainable fishing methods.",

restoration strategy. The 10+ year classification as bare land, combined with the areas' historical ecological significance and current degradation, creates an ideal opportunity for large-scale ecosystem restoration with significant climate, biodiversity, and community benefits.",
      "G205": "**From Section 2.2.1:**\nThe project is developed in a tropical mangrove forest, which is degraded due to continuous deforestation for wood extraction and fishing activities. The area where the activities are being implemented has been classified as bare land for the last 10 years.\n\nAlthough more details about the physical conditions can be found in Section 2.1.14, the main environmental conditions of the Sine Saloum Delta and Casamance Estuary are the following[12]:\n\nSine Saloum Delta:\n\n- Climate: Hot semiarid and dry tropical savanna. The mean annual temperature ranges from 27.2 to 30ºC, total annual rainfall is 450–920 mm.\n- Hydrology: The area is nourished by the Saloum River.\n- Topography: 0 meters of altitude being the area at sea level.\n- Relevant historical conditions: The area has been affected by wood extraction and fishing activities during several years.\n- Soils: Halomorphic, Ferralitic, Hydromorphic, tropical Ferruginous, mineral and poorly evolved soils.\n- Vegetation: Coastal mangroves (*Rhizophora racemosa* and *Rhizophora mangle*; *Avicennia africana*), herbaceous formations along the watercourses, and tree steppes (generally roasted trees) on the hillsides. The upstream areas are occupied by halophytic grasses and *Tamarix senegalensis.*\n- Ecosystems: Mangrove ecosystems.\n\nCasamance Estuary:\n\n- Climate: Sudano-Guinean climate- The mean annual precipitation reaches 1,300 mm/year and the mean annual temperature is 27ºC.\n- Hydrology: The area is nourished by the Casamance River.\n- Topography: 0 meter of altitude being the area at sea level.\n- Relevant historical conditions: The area has been affected by wood extraction and fishing activities during several years.\n- Soils: Ferralitic, Hydromorphic, Mineral, Mudflats and poorly evolved soils.\n- Vegetation: The main groups of vegetation are stands of oil palm (*Elaeis guineensis*), bamboo (*Oxythenantera abyssinica*) and roan (*Borassus aethiopium*): Ndimb (Cordyla pinnata), Kapokier (*Bombax costatum*), Néré (*Parkia biglobosa*), Santan (*Daniellia oliveri*), Vène (*Pterocarpus erinaceus*), Cailcédrat (*Khaya senegalensis*), Fromager (*Ceiba pentandra*), Ditakh (*Detarium senegalensis*). The Casamance mangrove is floristically richer and denser than the mangroves of the Saloum estuary and the Senegal River. It is made up of *Rhizophora racemosa*, *Rhizophora harissonii* and *Rhizophora* mangle for the *Rhizophora genus*, *Avicennia nitida* or *africana*, *Laguncularia racemosa* and *Conocarpus erectus*, all *Combretaceae*.\n- Ecosystems: Mangrove ecosystems.\n\nThe baseline scenario (the same one as the conditions prior to the project scenario) is described in section 3.1.4 (\"Baseline Scenario\") following the requirements of the VM0033 Methodology. Before the implementation of the project activities, there was mangrove deforestation and degradation due to wood extraction and fishing activities.\n\nThe project has a 40-year lifetime, and it is designed to endure indefinitely. This longevity is ensured through ongoing community awareness and collaboration with Senegalese authorities.",
      "G206": "**From Section 2.2.2:**\nThe most likely scenario is the continuation of mangrove ecosystem degradation. The various studies of mangrove dynamics (Dieye et al., 2018) in Oussouye, (Solly et al., 2017) Thiobon and long before them, Marius (1985) have shown that mangrove ecosystems have experienced a significant decline during the 1970s and 1980s. The study of its spatio-temporal dynamics, using geomatics tools coupled with field surveys, made it possible to apprehend its decline between 1972 and 1994. The factors behind the decline during the 1970s and 1980s were mainly the rainfall deficit, with the consequences of salinization and acidification of the land, and the weakness of natural regeneration. The main evidence of the continuity of degradation lies in the fact that after their degradation (mostly in the 1970s together with severe droughts) these areas have not recovered and there are no signs of natural recovery.\n\nEligible project sites have been identified as identical to themselves (bare land) for at least 10 years. In it, there was evidence that the areas selected for reforestation are degraded and have been for at least the last 20 years. In that sense, they will most likely continue to be degraded areas in the future in the case of the without project scenario.",
      "G207": "Under the without-project scenario, project activities would not have been implemented due to investment and social barriers. Several obstacles, including limited access to new sustainable fishing activities and technical support for alternative cooking methods, hinder community progress, who keep extracting wood from mangroves in an unsustainable way. Consequently, without the project, the climate, community, and biodiversity benefits would not take place and landscape degradation would continue. Despite the existence of national laws and regulations to protect mangroves (see section 2.5.1 \"National and Local Laws\"), they are not always adequately enforced or implemented. As a result, activities such as illegal logging are present in these unique ecosystems.\n\nWithout the project, the continued degradation of the areas would lead to dwindling resources, adversely impacting the well-being of communities. Mangroves, vital ecosystems that provide essential resources such as food (fish, oysters...), would be particularly affected, exacerbating the challenges faced by local communities. To optimize socio-economic benefits, the project design was developed through a participatory approach. The project implementer conducted interviews and consultations with local communities to understand their preferences, aspirations, and concerns. This ensured that the proposed project activities aligned closely with the communities' desires for livelihood development.\n\nIn the absence of the project, biodiversity would continue to decline due to habitat loss. Mangroves have been adversely affected by environmental factors and wood extraction, resulting in degraded ecosystems. Without intervention, this trend would persist, further threatening biodiversity (Conchedda, Lambin & Mayaux, 2011). With the project, new habitats for biodiversity will be created, at the same time other aspects such as soil erosion will be controlled, protecting and enhancing the natural resources of the area.",

      "G323": "Senegal provides an example of coastal erosion. Between 1954 and 2002 the coastline retreated by an average of 2.2 m per year, reaching 3 m per year between 2014 and 2018 (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11852-020-00742-y). This coastal retreat is destroying houses, tourist buildings and fishing infrastructure, and leading to the disappearance of beaches and the loss of agricultural land. The advance of the sea is also making groundwater more saline and unsuitable for human consumption and agriculture. In estuarine areas, an increase in salinity affects mangroves and fisheries. The Saloum River delta coast is currently subject to climate-change-induced coastal-erosion hazards. A Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) analysis found CVI values between 9.13 and 40.82, with very-high-vulnerability shoreline extending from Diakhanor to Niodior (Sakho et al., 2022: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-022-10741-y). Shoreline retreat could reach −268 m by 2050, threatening socio-economic infrastructure and human settlements. Adaptation options identified focus on soft approaches such as strategic retreat, artificial beach nourishment and dune fixation. Following this methodology, ALLCOT estimated that cumulative land loss due to sea-level rise over the 40-year project lifetime will be approximately 5 percent.",
      "G324": "#### 3.2.2.4 Projection of Future Conditions\n\nEx-ante estimates of GHG-WPS are based on a project scenario that is defined ex-ante and projected using the latest version of the following VCS module: VMD0019 Methods to Project Future Conditions.\n\nResults of the application of this module are provided in APPENDIX 7: Projection of Future Conditions in The Baseline and Project Scenarios.\n\n#### VMD0019 Methods to Project Future Conditions\n\nPreparation of ex-ante projections of GHG pools and emissions under the baseline and project scenarios requires making informed estimates of future values of a wide range of variables.\n\nThis module is designed to allow the projection of future values of some variables which has been identified as having a significant influence on the future GHG impacts of emissions or changes in pools under the baseline or project scenario.\n\n#### RELEVANT DEFINITIONS IN VMD0019\n\nFor a better understanding of the following paragraphs, the meaning of some concepts is briefly explained:\n\n#### **Types of Variables**\n\nLocation specific: The variable is associated with the land and varies across the landscape.\n\nProcess specific. Process specific variables are associated with specific actions, ongoing events, or global conditions, rather than with specific locations.\n\n#### **Categories**\n\nEither of these types of variables can fall into one of 3 categories:\n\na) *Controlled.* The future value of the variable will primarily be a result of actions under the control of the project proponent.\n\nb) *Planned.* The future value of the variable will primarily be a result of actions under the control of agents other than the project proponent, but where those agents have made plans that will determine the future value of the variable.\n\nc) *Systemic.* The future value of the variable will primarily be a result of systemic forces, such as market forces, climate change, or demographic change.\n\n#### **Classes of Variables**\n\nThe combination of type and category results in 6 classes of variables:\n\n- 1) Controlled variable, either location or process specific\n- 2) Planned variable, either location or process specific\n- 3) Systemic variable, location specific\n- 4) Systemic variable, process specific\n\nClasses will then require different sequences of steps to project the future conditions of the variable based on VMD0019, as follows:\n\n- *1) Controlled variable, either location or process specific*\n\t- Step 10 to determine the limits to the possible values of the variable\n\t- Step 11 to verify the planned actions of the project proponent\n- *2) Planned variable, either location or process specific*\n\t- Step 10 to determine the limits to the possible values of the variable\n\t- Step 12 to verify the planned actions of the agents impacting the value of the variable\n- *3) Systemic variable, location specific*\n\t- Step 7 to determine the historic trends in the value of the variable\n\t- Step 8 to determine the agents, causes and drivers impacting the value of the variable\n\t- Step 9 to re-examine the category of the variable. It is possible that during this step variables will be found to be controlled or planned, even though they were initially assessed as systemic. In that case, follow the sequence of steps for either controlled or planned variables. Step 10, to determine the limits to the possible values of the variable\n\t- Step 14 to project the future values of the variable\n- *4) Systemic variable, process specific*\n\t- Step 6 to determine the historic trends in the value of the variable\n\t- Step 8 to determine the agents, causes and drivers impacting the value of the variable\n\t- Step 9 to re-examine the category of the variable\n\t- Step 10 to determine the limits to the possible values of the variable\n\t- Step 14 to project the future values of the variable\n\n#### **Temporal Character of Variables**\n\n- 1. Historic. The variable is a characteristic which existed at some time in the past under the baseline scenario.\n- 2. Current. The variable is a characteristic which exists at the current time under the baseline scenario.\n- 3. Projected. The variable is a characteristic which will arise as a result of projected human activities at some time in the future under the baseline scenario.\n- 4. Intended. The variable is a characteristic which will arise as a result of the project activities under the project scenario.\n\n#### **Baseline Scenario Application**\n\nFollowing the steps described in the VMD0019:\n\n**Step 1:** Define the geographic area(s) within which the variable is to be projected - Project area\n\n**Step 2:** Identify the scenario under which the variable is to be projected - Baseline scenario\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the type and category of the variable being projected\n\n**Step 4:** Temporal character of the variable\n\n#### **Project Scenario Application**\n\nFollowing the steps described in the VMD0019:\n\n**Step 1:** Define the geographic area(s) within which the variable is to be projected - Project area\n\n**Step 2:** Identify the scenario under which the variable is to be projected - Project scenario\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the type and category of the variable being projected\n\n**Step 4:** Temporal character of the variable\n\n#### **GHG Emission Calculations**\n\nThe total net GHG emission reductions from the ARR/RWE project activity are calculated as follows:\n\nNERRWE= GHGBSL – GHGWPS + FRP – GHGLK\n\n- NERRWE: Net CO2e emission reductions from the RWE project activity\n- GHGBSL = Net CO2e emissions in the baseline scenario\n- GHGWPS = Net CO2e emissions in the project scenario\n- FRP = Fire Reduction Premium (net CO2e emission reductions from organic soil combustion due to rewetting and fire management). The FRP = 0 because organic soils and fire are not present in the project area.\n- GHGLK = Net CO2e emissions due to leakage. Since leakage is not considered, GHGLK are accounted as zero.\n\nTherefore, considering that FRP and GHGLK are zero, the following formula applies:\n\nNERRWE= GHGBSL – GHGWPS\n\n#### **Long-term benefit in WRC projects**\n\nIn accordance with the applied methodology, for projects claiming reductions of baseline GHG emissions, or for conservation and restoration projects where sea level rise may cause a loss of tidal wetland and associated biomass and/or soil organic carbon stocks, the maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions or removals that may be claimed from the biomass and soil organic carbon pool is limited to the net GHG benefit generated by the project 100 years after its start date. Thus, since the project is a restoration project where the sea level raise may cause a loss of tidal area, the following applies:\n\nNERRWE-max = NERRWE at t = 100\n\nWhere:\n\n- NERRWE-max = Maximum net CO2e emission reductions or removals that can be claimed from the RWE project activity at any point in time during the crediting period; Tco2e\n- NERRWE = Net CO2e emission reductions from the RWE project activity; Tco2e\n\nDue to the net GHG emissions in the baseline scenario are zero, the carbon stock in the project scenario at t = 100 determines the maximum quantity.\n\n#### **Estimation of uncertainty**\n\nThe adjusted value for NERt to account for uncertainty is calculated as:\n\nadjusted_NERt = NERt x (100% - NERERROR + allowable_uncert)\n\nWhere:\n\n- adjusted_NERt: Net GHG emission reductions in year t adjusted to account for uncertainty; Tco2e\n- NERt Total net GHG emission reductions from the project activity up to year t; Tco2e\n- NERERROR : Total uncertainty for WRC project activity; %\n- Allowable_uncert: Allowable uncertainty; 20% or 30% at a 90% or 95% confidence level, respectively; %\n\nFor the baseline scenario, there is no uncertainty associated with key variables, because they are based on default values. For the project scenario, uncertainties for most variables will be quantified in the monitoring plan. The determination of uncertainties of certain variable is conditional on the method chosen.\n\n#### **Calculation of Verified Carbon Units:**\n\nIn order to calculate the number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs), the number of buffer credits which must be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account is calculated using AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Report Excel Calculation Tool, v4.2. The result obtained is 12%.\n\n#### **Leakage Assessment**\n\nAs described in the VM0033 Methodology, there is no leakage as the project meets the applicability conditions. The project will only focus on the plantation of mangrove species in degraded mangrove areas, and therefore it will not lead to a significant increase in GHG emissions outside the project area. The activities will not cause alteration of mean annual water table depths or flooding frequency or duration in adjacent areas or limit such alteration to levels that do not influence GHG emissions. Therefore, leakage is \"0\".\n\n#### **Ecological Leakage Avoidance Criteria**\n\n| Ecological leakage process outside project boundary | Avoidance criterion |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Lowering water table that causes increased soil carbon oxidation | The wetland conditions are maintained during the lifespan of the project |\n| Lowering water table that causes increased N2O emissions | The hydrological conditions are not modified due to the project. |\n| Raising water table that causes increased CH4 emissions | The hydrological conditions are not modified due to the project. |\n| Raising water table that causes decreased vegetation production that causes decreased new soil carbon sequestration | The hydrological conditions are not modified due to the project. Therefore, it does not cause an alteration of vegetation cover outside the Project Area. The presence of mangrove trees inside the Project Area will slow tidal flows and increase sediment deposition reducing sediment that flows into the sea, which does not lead to a decreased carbon sequestration outside the Project Area. |",

Projects that do not quantify reductions of baseline emissions (i.e., those that limit their accounting to GHG removals in biomass and/or soil) do not need to estimate SDT. This project does not claim emissions reductions from mineral soil, so it is not needed to estimate the SDT. Ineligible wetland areas: For projects quantifying CO2 emission reductions, project areas which do not achieve a significant difference (5%) in cumulative carbon loss over a period of 100 years beyond the project start date are not eligible for crediting based on the reduction of baseline emissions, and these areas must be mapped.

For more than 10 years, the area has been affected by human activities such as illegal logging and has been continuously converted to bare land. Illegal wood extraction and fishing would keep going without the project.</li><li>Scenario 2: Natural regeneration: Some studies have shown the resilience of mangroves. These complex ecosystems are resilient to salinity and rainfall variations, and therefore, to climate change. Although some scientists have shown their concern about the decrease of mangrove forest cover, others state that due to the low level of human impacts (e.g. there are no dams in the Sine Saloum Delta or Casamance Estuary) mangroves can recover naturally (Andrieu et al., 2020).</li><li><p>Scenario 3: Forestation of the land within the project boundary performed without being registered as VCS WRC project activity: It could be possible to have a scenario where a reforestation program would be in place without being registered as a project activity intended for the carbon market, but, although there is a willingness from the Government to recover mangrove ecosystems, no economic incentives are given to communities, and therefore no planting activities are being implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Outcome Sub-step 1a:</strong> The List of credible alternative land use scenarios that would have occurred on the land within the project boundary of the project activity is:</p></li><li>Scenario 1: Continuation of the pre-project land use&nbsp;</li><li>Scenario 2: Natural regeneration&nbsp;</li><li>Scenario 3: Forestation of the land within the project boundary performed without being registered as the A/R CDM project activity:</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><u>Sub-step 1b.

The restored mangrove resulted of the project activities, , with their complex root systems, will act as natural sediment traps, slowing down water flow, causing sediments carried by tides, and waves to settle out of the water column and accumulate on the forest floor. Over time, this leads to the buildup of soil, which can help counteract erosion and subsidence in coastal areas.</li><li>Changing salinity characteristics (e.g., restoring tidal flow to tidally-restricted areas). The project will restore the tidal flow, thus, diluting concentrated salt levels, bringing salinity back within a range that is conducive to mangrove growth and the overall health of the ecosystem.</li><li>Improving water quality (e.g., reducing nutrient loads leading to improved water clarity to expand seagrass meadows, recovering tidal and other hydrologic flushing and exchange or reducing nutrient residence time). The restored mangrove, through the root systems will trap sediments carried by rivers and tides. These sediments often contain pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and other contaminants. By trapping these particles, mangroves prevent them from entering open waters, thereby reducing water pollution. On the other hand, the project activity, once the mangrove is restored, will reduce coastal erosion by stabilizing shorelines with their root systems, preventing the resuspension of sediments, which can carry pollutants and degrade water quality.</li><li>(Re-)introducing native plant communities (e.g., reseeding or replanting).

      "G737": "The MRV system of the project has been configured as a procedure designed to collect and aggregate the information needed to calculate, measure, and verify the removals of GHG emissions produced because of the different actions developed under the VM0033 Methodology – \"Methodology for tidal wetlands and seagrass restoration\". The monitoring plan will be implemented during the longevity of the project, even if that period is longer than the crediting period. 1. Monitoring System The measurement of GHG emissions and emission removals is a critical element for the ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project and must be carried out as accurately as possible. To this end, the first phase of information capture is the basis for the proper functioning of the MRV system. GHG removals and co-benefits will be calculated periodically based on progress indicators and other relevant factors that allow the emissions trajectory to be reassessed and adjusted. The MRV design includes the definition of GHG metrics and co-benefit indicators that can be measured with reasonable certainty. The principles of the monitoring plan defined are: - Transparency - Consistency - Accuracy - Comparability - Completeness or comprehensiveness 2. Stages of the monitoring process The stages of the Monitoring system of the project are: - Capture of information: the Senegalese local team is in charge of collecting the information and uploading it to Allcot's server. As per the Methodology for Tidal Wetlands and Seagrass Restoration (VM0033), Chapter 2 (Approaches to Data Collection) of the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance are used. All data collected during each monitoring period will be stored and archived in hardcopy and softcopy formats for a period of two years after the end of the longevity of the project. Field measurements will be recorded in standardized formats to ensure accurate data collection. Data will be collected following all stated QA/QC procedures (detailed in each parameter) via trained personnel. All parameter data collection frequency, i.e., the monitoring period, will be set to a minimum of once per two years and a maximum of every five years. Calibration of equipment will be done as per the technical specifications and/or the project manager and the GIS expert decide as necessary. Collection of data and parameters for monitoring follow the standard operation procedure (SOP). Specifically: - Carbon parameters: The capture of information on the forestry component starts with the completion of field forms, which were adjusted to record the relevant information for forest monitoring, with variables such as diameter at breast height, mortality and density. Physical forms is scheduled, because the weather conditions, in addition to the limited internet access in the project area, do not allow the use of electronic devices for the storage of information. - Biodiversity and community parameters: the parameters related to the biodiversity and communities component will be also monitored and information gathered following the internal SOP created by the project proponent. Depending on the parameter, different data gathering processes are implemented: biodiversity inventories, eDNA analysis or surveys as they are defined in the specific sections. - Information processing: the coordinator is in charge of revising and processing all the information in the MRV system database, as well as its quality control. Considering the volume of data to be handled, it is necessary to manage an adequate database for the organization, storage and management of information; Likewise, the handling of a large amount of information makes it necessary to incorporate a mirror database that allows the information captured in the field to be duplicated in order to carry out the respective controls on data capture, ensuring the quality of the original information. - Reporting: the coordinator will report after each activity and before each verification event the performance of the information collection. - Verification: An external and independent entity will be in charge of verifying the results of the MRV process. 3. Roles and responsibilities: The roles and responsibilities are defined in the following table: CoordinatorAdopt internal quality control processes and a continuous improvement plan. Process the data provided by the local teams with the agreed periodicity. Contract the verification of the data and the MRV system as a whole, defining the responsibilities, work plan, and operational basis for this process. Local teamCollect data on the field in accordance with the training received by the coordinator. Communicate any incident during the process of monitoring. Perform training for local communities (if needed) for monitoring activities. 4. Procedures for internal auditing and QA/QC. According to section 9.3.2 of methodology VM0033, quality management procedures are required for the management of data and information, including the assessment of uncertainty relevant to the project and baseline scenarios. To ensure that carbon stocks are estimated in a way that is accurate, verifiable, transparent, and consistent across measurement periods, the Quality Assurance and Quality Control for the project has been implemented in all the parameters. All the documentation is reviewed by a technical reviewer part of the technical team of ALLCOT to assure that is consistent and free of mistakes. 5. Adaptive Management The monitoring procedure includes a feedback loop that allows to adjust activities based on QC findings, ensuring continuous improvement. Independent Oversight: Engage third-party experts to conduct periodic reviews of the QC processes to maintain impartiality and ensure that the project adheres to international best practices. 6. Stratification Different stratifications may be required for the baseline and the project scenarios looking for higher homogeneity inside each stratum to improve precision. Stratification for ex-ante estimations of actual net GHG removals by sinks was primarily conducted based solely on region (Casamance and Sini Saloum deltas) and planting year. In future verifications, and as the differences in growth and mortality rates become noticeable between the different zones of the project area, the stratification criteria might be readapted. The project will use permanent or temporal circular sample plots located randomly within the project area or systematically with a random start, which is considered good practice in GPG-LULUCF to avoid subjective choice of plot locations. The sample plot area will be determined before each verification event. The number of samples and sample size will be determined using \"Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A/R CDM project activities (Version 02.1.0)\" to reach the targeted precision level of ±10% of the mean of the measured variables at the 90% confidence level in a cost-effective manner. The number of required sample plots (n) will be calculated using equation 2 of the abovementioned tool since the sampled area is expected to be less than 5% of the project area: n = ( (t,val × Σ(wi × si)) / E )^2 Where, n = Number of sample plots required for estimation of biomass stocks within the project boundary; dimensionless t,val = Two-sided Student's t-value at infinite degrees of freedom for the required confidence level; dimensionless E = Acceptable margin of error (i.e., one-half the confidence interval) in estimation of biomass stock within the project boundary; t d.m. (or t d.m. ha-1) wi = Relative weight of the area of stratum i (i.e., the area of the stratum i divided by the project area); dimensionless si = Estimated standard deviation of biomass stock in stratum i; t d.m. (or t d.m. ha-1) The number of plots allocated to each stratum will be calculated using equation 4 of the tool: ni = n × (wi × si) / Σ(wi × si) Where: ni = Number of sample plots allocated to stratum i; dimensionless n = Number of sample plots required for estimation of biomass stocks within the project boundary; dimensionless wi = Relative weight of the area of stratum i (i.e., the area of the stratum i divided by the project area); dimensionless si = Estimated standard deviation of biomass stock in stratum i; t d.m. (or t d.m. ha-1) During the monitoring process, a re-assessment of the plot size may be necessary depending on the characteristics of the ex-post strata. The date of last measurement of sample plot, will be considered to be the date of estimation of carbon stock, even if the full process of measurement extends over a period of time.",

      "G744": "Climate change is causing adverse impacts worldwide. Threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, and food security encompass a wide array of challenges, including habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change-induced disruptions. These threats compromise the resilience of ecosystems, disrupt food chains, and jeopardize the availability of essential resources (Abbass et al., 2022). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported a significant rise in global surface temperatures, with a 1.09°C increase observed in 2011–2020 compared to 1850–1900. This is close to surpassing the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise to below 2ºC to avert severe consequences. Despite efforts, temperatures continue to escalate, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced climate action (IPCC, 2023). Senegal, as the rest of the countries, is affected by climate change. Climatic hazards such as floods and droughts have an impact on ecosystems and in the socio-economic development of the different regions (Kayal, 2023). Mbaye et al., (2019) have studied that seasonal changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and water balance are more remarkable in the east of the country, where the project is located. Regarding extreme events, droughts will affect the north and the east of the country, meanwhile flood events are likely to occur on coastal areas of the southeast. This information is represented in the following Figures: Dryness that affected African continent in the 1970s, caused a deterioration of the mangroves of Senegal, especially those found near the river tributary, Bintang Bolon. A high mortality of the mangroves occurred, presumably due to deeper tidal penetration and accompanying increased water and soil salinity. Sea level rise poses a major threat to mangrove ecosystems through sediment erosion, inundation stress and increased salinity at landward zones. These problems will be exacerbated for mangrove stands that are subjected to 'coastal squeeze', i.e. where landward migration is restricted by topography or human developments. Increased air temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are also likely to increase mangrove productivity, change phenological patterns, and expand the ranges of mangrove forests into higher latitudes. Mangrove recession events and replacement by lagoon environments are shown to occur during more rapid sea-level rise in different countries. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to the effects of climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Inter-related and spatially variable climate change factors including sea level rise, increased storminess, altered precipitation regime and increasing temperature are impacting mangroves of Senegal. Mangroves help to stabilize the coastline and prevent erosion from waves and storms. In areas where mangroves have been cleared, coastal damage from hurricanes is much more severe. By filtering out sediments, the forests also protect coral reefs and seagrass meadows from being smothered in sediment Restoring degraded mangrove will offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal restoration will facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, and rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas as this project will reduce the impact of these scenarios. Without the project, the Sine Saloum Delta and Casamance Estuary will continue to experience severe droughts and floods, which will lead to coastal erosion. These events can be mitigated with the recovery of mangroves (Arumugam, 2021).",
      "G745": "As it mentioned before, the main climate change impacts in the project area and communities living around the project are increasing of temperatures and sea level rise. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification will lead to shifts in fish populations and decline in fish stocks. Therefore, decreased fish catch, affecting the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing, leading to economic losses and food shortages. On the other hand, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events can lead to more frequent flooding, causing waterborne diseases. Higher incidence of diseases like cholera and malaria, straining local healthcare systems and reducing overall community health. Altered precipitation patterns and increased evaporation rates can reduce the availability of fresh water, and increase salinity, so, the consequence is water scarcity, affecting drinking water supply, sanitation, and agricultural irrigation, leading to conflicts over water resources. The higher salinity affects the survival of the mangrove. This degradation of mangroves in the project area primarily stems from human activities, notably illegal wood extraction and overfishing. Furthermore, rising sea levels and increased salinity stress mangrove ecosystems, leading to die-offs or reduced growth, so, loss of critical habitats for numerous species, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem services such as coastal protection and carbon sequestration. The communities in the area face profound poverty and encounter significant barriers in accessing fundamental services like healthcare and education. Furthermore, the existing infrastructure fails to adequately support the mobility and integration of these groups, exacerbating their isolation from opportunities for development and progress. With Senegal's coastal regions already feeling the effects of climate change, the combination of activities and the vulnerability of these communities is negatively impacting their well-being. In summary, climate changes directly impact agricultural productivity, fisheries, health, infrastructure, and water resources, leading to economic, health, and social challenges for local communities, thus, the consequence is reduced community resilience and well-being, increased poverty, and social instability. Climate changes alter ecosystems, affecting the distribution and survival of species, and introducing new threats such as invasive species, therefore, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, and diminished ecosystem services, further impacting both human and wildlife population.",
      "G746": "The measures designed to assist communities and biodiversity to adapt to the probable impacts of climate change are summarized in the following table: Table 14 – Measures designed to assist communities",
      "G749": "Senegal covers an area of 196,712 km^2 (ANSD , 2019), at the extreme west of the African continent, and borders Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, the Republic of Guinea to the southeast and Guinea-Bissau to the south. The Gambia, a sovereign state, is an enclave that divides the country at the level of the natural regions of the Sine. The project is located in two regions, Fatick and Ziguinchor. 1. Fatick region In 2013, the population of this region was recorded at 714,392 (ANSD, 2021). According to projections derived from the 2013 population census, this number has surged to 1,000,679, comprising 497,706 men and 502,973 women. This indicates a growth rate of 40% over the span of 10 years. Such demographic expansion can largely be attributed to elevated fertility rates, with Senegalese women, on average, bearing 4.6 children (Demography and Health Survey, 2017). In terms of age structure, the population has a relatively high proportion of young people. This is reflected in the following indicators: the average age is 22, the median age is 16, and the population aged between 0 and 4 represented 18% of the total in 2019. About the spatial distribution of the population, there is an imbalance between the departments. The regional capital, Fatick, is the most populated department, accounting for 47.5% of the total population in 2019 (ANSD, 2021). It is followed by the department of Foundiougne (39.1%) and Gossas, the least populated (13.4%). The inhabitants belong to two main ethnic groups: the Sérères, who inhabit the Gandoul Islands and the edges of the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve (RBDS); and the Mandingues, who inhabit the Bétenti islands. The dominant religion in the area is the Islam. With respect to the migration dynamics, the Fatick region has become a departure zone, according to the results of the 2013 census. Senegal's migration profile shows a widening of the areas of departure and a spread of migratory behavior within the country. Regions that were previously unaffected by the phenomenon have gradually become areas with a high migration potential. This is due to recurring crisis affecting the population (poverty, unemployment, vulnerability), which are driving people to migrate to improve their living conditions. This phenomenon affects all regions of Senegal and the destinations have diversified considerably (ANSD and OIM11, 2018). The education and training sector includes integrated early childhood development, elementary (or primary) education, middle education and secondary education. In the early childhood sub-sector, there were 157 establishments in 2019, 107 of which were located in the departmental capital of Fatick (68.2%). The department of Foundiougne had 38 childcare facilities. In terms of early childhood establishments, there were 360 staff, 270 of whom were located in Fatick and 90 in Foundiougne. In addition, most of the staff have a school-leaving certificate (brevet de fin d'études moyennes), i.e. 232 out of 397 people (58% of the total workforce). There are 10,309 pre-school children in the project area, 52.3% of them girls. For the elementary cycle, the number of functional schools in the Fatick project area was 712 in 2019, including 347 in the department of Fatick and 239 in the department of Foundiougne. The increase in the number of elementary schools is most marked in Fatick department, which recorded a positive change of 3.3% between 2018 and 2019, compared with just 0.8% for the other two departments over the same period. There were 4,435 staff in the Fatick region as a whole. In contrast to early childhood education staff, the majority of primary school staff have a Baccalauréat qualification (52.9% of the total). Finally, 117,839 pupils were enrolled, 51% of them girls. The average number of pupils per teacher was 29 in 2019. In terms of middle and secondary education, there were 145 facilities in the departments in the project area, including 98 in the department of Fatick and 57 in the department of Foundiougne. There were 2,748 middle and secondary school teachers in the region in 2019. The average number of teachers per school was 25. Finally, the number of pupils was 68,588, 53% of whom were girls. Regarding the health system, the region has 354 health establishments. The health staff includes doctors, nurses, community health workers and support staff such as hospital administrators and ambulance drivers. In 2019, the Fatick region had 30 doctors. The problems that arise are the following: - Insufficient health infrastructure (health center in the Sokone district, health post). - Non-functional and under-equipped health centers. - Lack of staff training. - Low motivation of community staff. - High ambulance transport costs. - The isolation of certain localities (islands). When considering the most fundamental resource, water, the Fatick region falls below the national average. Merely 63.6% of households have access to drinking water, compared to the national average of 78.7%. Access includes taps and open wells. Regarding sanitation, 18% of households lack toilets in their homes, resorting to open-air defecation or public facilities. Regarding energy, there exist significant disparities among the populations of Fatick and Foundiougne departments. Residents rely on diverse energy sources, including electricity, firewood, solar energy, and fuel, to meet their needs. However, access to electricity varies markedly. Urban areas enjoy an access rate exceeding 80%, while rural areas face limited access due to inadequate territorial coverage. Despite challenges, Foundiougne department benefits from two electricity supply lines, facilitating private connections and public lighting. Yet, in island and rural regions, solar energy is gaining prominence, with a coverage rate of 33.6% as per data from the Foundiougne Departmental Development Plan (2017). 2. Ziguinchor region The region had a population of 526,945 in 2013 (ANSD, 2021). This figure has risen to 754,110, including 387,017 men and 367,093 women, according to projections from the 2013 population census, representing a growth rate of 41% in 10 years. In terms of age structure, the population of the Ziguinchor region is predominantly young, with a low proportion of elderly people. Only 4% of the population is aged 65 and over, while children aged 5 and under account for 18% of the total. The departments of Bignona and Ziguinchor concentrate most of the population, with 46% and 45% respectively of the regional population in 2019. Oussouye, on the other hand, has the smallest population, accounting for just 9% of the region's population (ANSD, 2021). Talking about ethnic groups, the Diolas are in the majority, making up 61% of the population. The other most represented ones are the Mandingue and the Pular, accounting for 9.3% and 8.8% of the population respectively. Diola villages are relatively spread out spatially, and their inhabitants are characterized by a high degree of political, economic and religious autonomy. With respect to the level of poverty in the regions, there are major differences between the administrative entities. Except for the Dakar region, which has the lowest poverty level (9%), the other regions can be divided into two groups, with poverty levels ranging from 40% to 65%. The Ziguinchor region is one of the poorest in Senegal, with a poverty rate of 51% (ANSD, EHCVM 2018/2019). The education and training sector includes integrated early childhood development, elementary (or primary) education, secondary education and higher education. In the early childhood sub-sector, there were 275 establishments in 2019, of which 161 (58%) were in the department of Bignona. The department of Ziguinchor had 75 childcare facilities, or 27% of the total. There were 1,265 childcare staff, of whom 521 were in Bignona, 558 in Ziguinchor and 186 in Oussouye. What's more, most of the staff in early childhood establishments do not have a diploma: 429 out of 8'6 people (48% of the total workforce). At departmental level, Bignona has the majority of those with a vocational aptitude certificate, with an estimated 65%. As for the holders of the elementary certificate of teaching ability, they are more numerous in the department of Ziguinchor (38%). For the elementary cycle, the number of functioning schools in the Ziguinchor region was 477 in 2019, including 296 in the Bignona department, 124 in Ziguinchor and 57 in Oussouye. The increase in the number of elementary schools in the Ziguinchor region between 2018 and 2019 was slight or even stagnant. There were 8,415 staff in the Ziguinchor region as a whole. Compared with 2018, when there were 3,405 teachers, the number of primary school staff more than doubled in 2019. Men represent 81% of the total number of staff. At the departmental level, Bignona has the largest number of staff in the region, with 4,788 teachers, or 57% of the total in 2019. It is followed by the department of Ziguinchor with 2,780 staff, or 33% of the total. Finally, Oussouye has only 10% of the region's staff, or 847. Finally, 108,223 pupils were enrolled, 48% of them girls. The average number of pupils per teacher was 12 in 2019. In terms of student numbers, there were 6,096 students in 2018. The main constraints to be noted are: - Weak involvement of local authorities in the provision of supplies at lycée and avonin level. - Insufficient classrooms and fencing for the structures. - Difficult working conditions for pupils and teachers (frequent strikes, overcrowding, lack of furniture and equipment). - Civil status problems for some pupils (late declaration by parents or losses due to population displacement caused by conflict). In terms of access to water, the ratio for the region is below the national average. Only 47.6% of households in Ziguinchor have access to drinking water, compared with 78.7% nationally. Access includes taps and open wells. In terms of access to toilets, only 1.5% of households have no toilet at all. The rest have either a flush toilet (34.2%), a paved latrine (27.2%) or a rudimentary pit (34.8%). In the Ziguinchor region, while the city of Ziguinchor enjoys a relatively consistent electricity supply, it's crucial to acknowledge the significant disparity in distribution across the department. Certain villages have gained access to renewable energy thanks to the efforts of NGOs and community-focused projects/programs, particularly targeting essential social infrastructure such as water supply for boreholes, electrification of youth hostels, community centers, health posts, and more. The department of Bignona, situated within this region, offers a diverse array of energy sources. These encompass solar and electrical energy primarily utilized for lighting and other income-generating activities, alongside fossil fuels like wood and charcoal for cooking purposes. Despite the coexistence of these resources, access to electricity remains challenging in certain parts of the department, although some villages have already begun to benefit from it.",

Mangroves filter and trap sediment from run-off and river water before it reaches adjacent ecosystems, reducing the turbidity of the water and allowing essential light to reach ecosystems. Mangroves therefore contribute to the survival of these adjacent ecosystems and the species they support. Protecting and restoring the mangrove is key to fight against big threats. Senegal’s coastline stretches along the Atlantic Ocean, providing habitats for a variety of marine life. Mangrove areas extending along the coast serve as nurseries for many marine species and provide important ecological services such as erosion control and water purification (Hardy et al., 2016).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Sine Saloum delta stands out as an invaluable habitat, boasting a rich tapestry of mangroves, lagoons, and sandy islands. This unique landscape holds aquatic biodiversity, encompassing various fish species, mollusks, and other animals such as dolphins which make this delta a vibrant space of life (Copernicus, 2024). Moreover, the project area is located near protected areas such as the Natural Reserve of Palmarin and the Saloum Delta National Park, sites with a remarkable number of species (Ramsar, 2024).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Casamance Estuary stands as another biodiversity hotspot, featuring a diverse variety of habitats that accommodates various species. Its salinity gradients and organic matter levels, typical of estuarine environments, create ideal conditions for a wide range of flora and fauna to thrive (Tine et al, 2022). This and the surrounding areas are a refuge for numerous species such as turtles or birds. Nearby, the Kalissaye Site (an area surrounded by wetlands), holds an important number of species, being also a feeding area for humpback dolphins and African manatees (Ramsar, 2024).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As it has been mentioned throughout the document, the Casamance Delta is a region located in southern Senegal, where the Casamance River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It is known for its rich biodiversity and ecological significance. The delta encompasses a wide range of habitats, including mangroves, estuaries, rivers, wetlands, and coastal areas, which support a diverse array of plant and animal species (Wetlands International, 2016).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the Sine Saloum Delta, also known due to its vast biodiversity, is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (UNESCO, 2011). It comprises a diverse range of habitats, including mangroves, tidal flats, sand dunes, salt pans, and savannah grasslands, supporting a wide array of plant and animal species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Flora</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the prominent features of the Casamance Estuary is its extensive mangrove forests, which provide crucial habitats for various species, including numerous fish, crabs, mollusks, and other invertebrates. They also serve as breeding grounds and nurseries for many marine organisms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These mangrove forests are composed of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive in the intertidal zone, forming a complex ecosystem that provides a vital habitat for various marine and bird species. They serve as spawning grounds and nurseries for many commercially important fish species, such as bream, tilapia, and mullet. Crabs, shrimps, and mollusks thrive among the mangrove roots, while numerous bird species, including pelicans, herons, and flamingos, rely on the delta’s mangroves for nesting and foraging. In both areas, wetlands and shallow waters are crucial for resident and migratory bird species traveling between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. All this is possible due to its incomparable landscape and vegetation (Simier et al., 2004; Mathieu, Taibou &amp; Aminata., 2018).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Casamance Estuary, the biodiversity of the Saloum Delta faces threats from habitat degradation, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. However, the region benefits from conservation efforts and sustainable practices, including the establishment of protected areas and community-based initiatives, which aim to preserve the delta’s and estuary’s unique biodiversity and ensure the long-term ecological health of the region. Mangrove forests of the project area exhibit a distinctive vegetation profile that is well adapted to the challenging intertidal environment composed of:</p><ul><li>Red Mangrove (Rhizophora spp.): It is easily identifiable by its prop roots that extend from the trunk and provide stability in the muddy substrate. Red mangroves can tolerate high salinity levels and often form dense stands along the water’s edge (Corcoran, Ravilious, and Skuja., 2007).</li><li>Black Mangrove (Avicennia spp.): Black mangroves have distinctive pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that protrude from the mud and allow the exchange of gases between the roots and the atmosphere. Black mangroves are well adapted to fluctuating water levels and can thrive in areas with lower salinity (Corcoran, Ravilious, and Skuja., 2007).</li><li>White Mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa): The white mangrove is a smaller tree species that is often found in the upper parts of the mangrove forests distributed in West Africa. It has smooth, pale bark and lacks the prop roots seen in red mangroves. White mangroves have salt-excreting glands on their leaves, enabling them to tolerate higher salinity levels (Lonard et al., 2020).</li><li>Buttonwood Mangrove (Conocarpus erectus): Although not technically a true mangrove, the buttonwood mangrove is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems in Senegal. It has small, leathery leaves and a gnarled, twisted appearance. Buttonwood mangroves are often found on higher ground, where they provide additional stability to the mangrove ecosystem. This species is well-known due to its tolerance to high temperatures and air-polluted conditions (Lonard et al., 2020)</li></ul><p>These mangrove species (all of them classified as “Least concern” by the IUCN) (IUCN, 2007) form a diverse and interconnected community that plays a crucial role in the overall ecosystem of the project area mangrove forests. Their specialized adaptations, such as aerial roots, salt tolerance, and gas exchange mechanisms, allow them to thrive in the challenging intertidal zone and provide important ecological services, including shoreline protection, sediment stabilization, and nursery habitat for numerous marine organisms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fauna</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Casamance Estuary and Sine Saloum Delta are renowned for their rich and diverse fauna, particularly within their wetlands and rivers. These habitats are crucial for both resident and migratory bird species, serving as significant stopover sites during long-distance migrations. Over 300 bird species, including herons, egrets, ibises, and kingfishers, find sanctuary in this region (Barlow and Wacher., 2005). The waters of these estuaries and coastal areas teem with marine life, supporting a variety of fish species, such as grouper, snapper, and barracuda, which are of great commercial importance (Diadhiou et al., 2018; Simier et al., 2004). Additionally, they provide a habitat for several sea turtle species, including the critically endangered hawksbill turtle (Amara et al., 2019).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The surrounding forests of Casamance and Sine Saloum are inhabited by various mammals, including monkeys, bush babies, and antelopes, creating a vibrant ecosystem. Reptiles, such as Nile crocodiles and numerous snake species, further enrich the biodiversity of the region (Simier et al., 2004; Forget, 2010). This combination of diverse ecosystems supports a complex and dynamic environment, highlighting the ecological significance of the Casamance Estuary and Sine Saloum Delta.</p><ul><li>Avifauna: The Estuary and the Delta are a haven for birdwatchers and ornithologists due to its rich birdlife. It is home to a diverse array of resident and migratory bird species. Waterbirds such as cormorants, darters, pelicans, herons, ibises, and kingfishers thrive in wetland habitats and estuaries. The delta serves as an important stopover for numerous migratory species during their long-distance journeys, attracting a wide variety of ducks, geese, and waders (Forget, 2010).</li><li>Marine Life: The waters of these areas harbor a wealth of marine biodiversity. The estuaries, coastal areas, and mangrove forests provide habitat for a vast array of fish species, including commercially important ones like grouper, snapper, barracuda, and various types of mullet. In addition to fish, the delta supports populations of sea turtles, including the critically endangered hawksbill turtle and the green turtle (Ndiaye, 2015; Dia Ibrahima, 2012).</li><li>Mammals: The Casamance Delta is home to a diverse range of mammalian species, although they may be more elusive compared to the avifauna. The surrounding forests and savannah grasslands are inhabited by primates such as the red colobus monkey and patas monkey. Other mammal species include hippopotamus, laments, antelopes, warthogs, mongooses, and rodents (Dème &amp; Sall., 2021; Oates &amp; Ting, 2015).</li><li>Reptiles and Amphibians: Nile crocodiles, one of Africa’s largest crocodile species, can be found in the waters and riverbanks of the delta. Several snake species, including venomous and non-venomous varieties, inhabit the region (Trape &amp; Mane, 2005).</li><li>Invertebrates: The mangrove areas in Casamance and Sine Saloum support a diverse assemblage of invertebrate species, many of which play essential ecological roles. Mangroves and wetland areas provide habitats for various crabs, shrimps, mollusks, and insects, which form the foundation of the food chain and contribute to nutrient cycling within the ecosystem (Gning, 2010; Diadhiou, 2017).</li></ul><p>Having the same impacts as the flora, the fauna in the project area and its surroundings have declined in the last decades. The exploitation of mangroves and other human activities such as fishing has led to the disappearance of many aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Additionally, the expansion of agriculture (mainly rice fields) and increasing salinity have negatively impacted biodiversity (Dia Ibrahima, 2012).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The species identified in Casamance and Sine Saloum by the Senegal National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) are represented in the tables below:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Table 19 – Lis of species identified in Casamance by the Senegal National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). ).

Research indicates that using a combination of different native species will have a more beneficial impact on biodiversity compared to using a single species. As these trees mature into forests, they will form ecological communities with dominant species of mature mangroves, aiding the reestablishment of other plant species and further enhancing biodiversity. Overall, the forest will not only protect the Casamance Delta and Sine Saloum Estuary against wind and waves, but it will also serve as a habitat for the growth and reproduction of marine organisms such as fish, shrimp, and crabs. These forest formations are essential for preserving biological diversity and offer significant ecological and socio-economic benefits to local communities.

These impacts are detailed in previous sections, but summarized as:\n\n- **Enhance alternative livelihoods**: Improved income opportunities through sustainable fisheries, eco-tourism, and employment in restoration activities will provide positive direct impact in the community. But also, will indirectly impact in the availability of fish and other aquatic resources contributing to local food security.\n- **Capacity Building**: Training and capacity-building programs for local communities in sustainable management practices, enhance their skills and knowledge. Thus, the capacity programme will directly impact in the communities, involving them in decision-making processes, project implementation, design of productive projects and thus fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.\n• **Improved well-being**: The produce will reduce diseases through improved water quality and ecosystem health. The communities will benefit from the medicinal plants and other resources from the restored mangrove ecosystems. And through the different productive projects, the communities will have support to develop infrastructure, to generate income from alternative livelihoods, and thus, to improve their quality of life.",

Creation of the role of gender inspectors in charge of assuring that the activities are implemented considering</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The detailed net impact identified on women are:</p><ul><li>Livelihood Opportunities: Mangrove restoration projects will create new livelihood opportunities for women, such as nursery establishment, planting, and monitoring may generate employment or income-generating activities. Women who traditionally rely on mangrove resources for their livelihoods, such as gathering shellfish or collecting firewood, may benefit from the restoration efforts by having access to more abundant and healthier mangrove ecosystems.</li><li>Enhanced Food Security: Restored mangrove ecosystems will contribute to improved food security for communities, including women. Mangroves serve as nurseries for various fish and shellfish species. With the recovery of mangrove habitats, fish populations can increase, providing more diverse and accessible sources of protein for local communities, including women and their families.</li><li>Increased Resilience to Climate Change: Mangroves play a crucial role in coastal protection and climate change adaptation. Restored mangroves will provide a natural barrier against coastal erosion, storm surges, and sea-level rise, protecting communities and their livelihoods. By enhancing the resilience of coastal areas, restoration projects indirectly benefit women, who are often more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</li><li>Improved Health and Well-being: Restoration projects can have positive impacts on the health and well-being of women. Mangroves contribute to the purification of water by filtering pollutants and providing a natural buffer against waterborne diseases. Access to clean water and improved sanitation, resulting from the restoration efforts, can reduce the burden on women who are typically responsible for fetching water and taking care of household health.</li><li>Enhanced Community Participation and Decision-Making: ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project emphasize community participation and engagement. This will provide opportunities for women to actively participate in decision-making processes, contributing their knowledge and perspectives to project planning and implementation. Increased participation can help address gender disparities, promote women’s empowerment, and strengthen their role in natural resource management and governance.</li><li>Increased Workload and Time Burden: In some cases, the project may increase the workload and time burden on women. For example, if women are primarily responsible for planting and maintenance activities, they may have additional tasks to juggle alongside their existing household and caregiving responsibilities. The team will ensure that women’s involvement in restoration activities is accompanied by adequate support, training, and recognition of their contributions.</li></ul><p>To maximize the positive impacts and minimize potential negative effects on women, the ABC Blue Carbon Mangrove Project adopts a gender-responsive approach. This involves conducting gender analyses, involving women in project planning and implementation, addressing gender-specific needs and priorities, and promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment throughout the restoration process.</p>",

Identification of the beneficiaries:</strong> The identification of beneficiaries and the types of benefits they receive depends heavily on understanding the key actors and the type of incentives that will be most effective in achieving the overall program’s objectives, equity within legal, social, and cultural contexts, and efficiency in meeting the objectives at the least cost. Therefore, a proper identification is carried out before following with the next steps.</p><p>4. Creation of the budget: This includes costs associated with activities such as stakeholder engagement, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, and community development initiatives. The budget will include direct costs (e.g., personnel, equipment) and indirect costs (e.g., administrative overheads).</p><p>5. Monitoring and Tracking of the investment: One person in each Committee shall oversee the monitoring and tracking of the investments. This person will have to report each month the movements. The steering committee shall implement proper documentation and recordkeeping practices to maintain a transparent and auditable financial trail. This includes keeping track of receipts, invoices, and other financial documents.</p><p>6. Cost Control Measurement: Implement cost control measures to ensure that the investment in the Benefit Sharing mechanism remains within the allocated budget. This will involve:&nbsp;</p><p style=margin-left:40px;>a. Setting spending limits,&nbsp;</p><p style=margin-left:40px;>b. Seeking cost-effective solutions, and&nbsp;</p><p style=margin-left:40px;>c.

Creation of procurement guidelines and processes to avoid overspending or potential misuse of funds and prioritizing local providers.</p><p>8. Risk Management: Identify and assess financial risks that may impact the investment in the Benefit Sharing mechanism. This can include risks such as changes in project scope, currency fluctuations, delays, or unforeseen expenses. The Steering Committees shall develop a risk management plan to mitigate potential financial risks. This may involve establishing contingency funds, diversifying funding sources, or obtaining appropriate insurance coverage. Regularly review and update the risk management plan to address emerging risks and ensure ongoing financial stability.</p><p>9. Reporting and Accountability: Regular reporting mechanisms will be established to provide transparency and accountability in the management of the investment. This will include: a. Financial reports, b. Progress updates, and c. Stakeholder engagement activities.</p><p>10. Periodic audits or independent reviews of financial records to ensure compliance with financial regulations and to maintain accountability.</p><p>11.

Ensure that stakeholders are informed about the use of funds and the progress of the Benefit Sharing mechanism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stakeholder participation will be done in all phases of benefit sharing, design, implementation, and evaluation, as an iterative process, to ensure that the BSM meets the needs and interests of the full range of stakeholders. Participation involves communication, consultation, participation in governance and implementation, as well as processes for managing complaints and conflicts. It will cover a range of participation from providing information to stakeholders and seeking their input, to positioning them as equal partners in governance and decision-making. In addition, transparency, and the provision of clear information to stakeholders about benefit sharing in a format they understand is essential to building trust with stakeholders and gaining their buy-in to the entire program.
