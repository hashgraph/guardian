## 2 SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODOLOGY

| <b>Additionality and Crediting Method</b> |                 |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Additionality                             | Activity method |
| Crediting Baseline                        | Project method  |

Wetland restoration occurs sporadically throughout the world primarily to create wildlife habitat, restore water quality and quantity levels and provide storm protection and food production. However, wetland restoration also provides the additional benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and climate change mitigation.

This methodology outlines procedures to estimate net greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals resulting from project activities implemented to restore tidal wetlands. Such activities may include creating, restoring, and/or managing hydrological conditions, sediment supply, salinity characteristics, water quality and/or native plant communities. Accordingly, this methodology is applicable to a wide range of project activities aimed at restoring and creating tidal wetlands, and emission reductions and removals are estimated primarily based on the ecological changes that occur as a result of such activities (e.g., increased vegetative cover, changes to water table depth).

This methodology also addresses the potential for the establishment of woody vegetation. As such, this methodology is categorized as a Restoring Wetland Ecosystems (RWE) and Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) methodology.

Project activities are expected to generate GHG emission reductions and removals through:

- Increased biomass
- Increased autochthonous soil organic carbon
- Reduced methane and/or nitrous oxide emissions due to increased salinity or changing land use
- Reduced carbon dioxide emissions due to avoided soil carbon loss

This methodology is applicable to projects located globally, and to all tidal wetland systems (i.e., tidal forests (such as mangroves), tidal marshes and seagrass meadows). For the additionality assessment, an activity method is used. A project method is used with respect to the crediting baseline for all projects.

{5}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

For strata with organic soil, this methodology sets out procedures for the estimation of peat depletion time (PDT). Likewise, for strata with mineral soils and sediments, this methodology provides procedures for the estimation of soil organic carbon depletion time (SDT). This methodology also includes an assessment of the maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions which may be claimed from the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool (either based on the difference between the remaining soil organic carbon stock in the project and baseline scenarios after 100 years (total stock approach), or the difference in cumulative carbon loss in both scenarios since the project start date (stock loss approach)).

To estimate carbon stock changes in tree and shrub biomass, this methodology uses procedures from CDM tool AR-Tool14 Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities. This methodology also provides a method to account for carbon stock changes in herbaceous vegetation.

Since biomass may be lost due to subsidence following sea level rise, restoration projects involving afforestation or reforestation may account for long-term carbon storage in wood products where trees are harvested before dieback.

GHG emissions from the SOC pool are estimated by assessing emissions of  $CO<sub>2</sub>$ , CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, which may be estimated via several methods (e.g., proxies, modeling, default factors, local published values). Where allochthonous SOC accumulates in the project scenario, a procedure is provided to deduct such carbon from net emission reductions.

Proxies for emissions from the SOC pool may include water table depth and soil subsidence (for which procedures from other methodologies and modules are used) and carbon stock change. For non-seagrass tidal wetland systems, a default factor may be used in the absence of local data.

 $CH<sub>4</sub>$  and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the baseline scenario may be conservatively set to zero. Where the project proponent demonstrates that CH<sup>4</sup> or N2O emissions do not increase in the project scenario compared to the baseline scenario, these emissions need not be accounted for.

This methodology also addresses anthropogenic peat fires occurring in drained areas and establishes a conservative default value (Fire Reduction Premium) based on fire occurrence and extension in the project area in the baseline scenario. The procedure is based on VCS module VMD0046 Methods for monitoring soil carbon stock changes and GHG emissions in WRC project activities. The approach avoids the direct assessment of GHG emissions from fire in the baseline and project scenarios.

This methodology also includes procedures to account for GHG emissions from prescribed burning (using literature-based emission factors for non-CO<sup>2</sup> GHGs) and fossil fuel use (by incorporating procedures from the CDM tool AR-Tool05 Estimation of GHG emissions related to fossil fuel combustion in A/R CDM project activities).

{6}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

This methodology includes procedures for the consideration of sea level rise with respect to determining the geographic boundaries of the project area, and the determination of the baseline scenario and baseline emissions.

Activity-shifting leakage and market leakage are deemed not to occur if the applicability conditions of this methodology are met. Furthermore, activity-shifting leakage and market leakage are deemed not to occur if the pre-project land use will continue during the project crediting period.

Under the applicability conditions of this methodology, ecological leakage does not occur by ensuring that the effect of hydrological connectivity with adjacent areas is insignificant (i.e., no alteration of mean annual water table depths will occur in such areas). In tidal wetland restoration projects, de-watering downstream wetlands is not expected.

This methodology provides the steps necessary for estimating the project's net GHG benefits, as represented by the equation below:

*NERRWE = GHGBSL – GHGWPS + FRP – GHGLK*

Where:

| NERRWE | = Net CO2e emission reductions from the RWE project activity                                                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GHGBSL | = Net CO2e emissions in the baseline scenario                                                                             |
| GHGWPS | = Net CO2e emissions in the project scenario                                                                              |
| FRP    | = Fire Reduction Premium (net CO2e emission reductions from organic soil combustion due to rewetting and fire management) |
| GHGLK  | = Net CO2e emissions due to leakage                                                                                       |

## 3 DEFINITIONS

In addition to the definitions set out in VCS document Program Definitions, the following definitions apply to this methodology:

#### Allochthonous Soil Organic Carbon

Soil organic carbon originating outside the project area and being deposited in the project area

#### Autochthonous Soil Organic Carbon

Soil organic carbon originating or forming in the project area (e.g., from vegetation)

#### Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE)

Type of sub-aquatic sediment deposition environment that impacts the amount of deposited organic carbon that is preserved. Carbon preservation is affected by mineral grain size, sediment accumulation and burial rates,  $O<sub>2</sub>$  availability in the overlying water column and sediment hydraulic conductivity.

{7}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### Degraded wetland

A wetland which has been altered by human or natural impact through the impairment of physical, chemical and/or biological properties, and in which the alteration has resulted in a reduction of the diversity of wetland-associated species, soil carbon or the complexity of other ecosystem functions which previously existed in the wetland

#### Deltaic Fluidized Mud

A Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE) type. This subaquatic depositional environment is characterized by sediment accumulation rates generally greater than 0.4 g sediment per cm<sup>2</sup> per year in deltaic settings, consisting primarily of fluidized (unconsolidated) fine-grain materials. Surface sediments may be re-suspended by waves and tides, but deposited organic matter will be buried. Examples of these can be found in the Amazon and Mississippi deltas.

#### Extreme Accumulation Rate

A Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE) type. This subaquatic depositional environment is characterized by accumulation rates generally greater than 1 g sediment per cm<sup>2</sup> per year resulting in rapid and long-term burial of deposited sediments. Examples of these systems can be found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Rhone River deltas.

#### Impounded Water

A pool of water formed by a dam or pit

#### Marsh

A subset of wetlands characterized by emergent soft-stemmed vegetation adapted to saturated soil conditions<sup>1</sup>

#### Mineral Soil

Soil that is not organic

#### Mudflat

A subset of tidal wetlands consisting of soft substrate not supporting emergent vegetation

#### Normal marine

A Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE) type. This is a depositional environment that does not meet the definition of the other four defined conditions (i.e., *deltaic fluidized mud*, *extreme accumulation rate*, *oxygen depletion zone*, or *small mountainous river*).

<sup>1</sup> There are many different kinds of marshes, ranging from the prairie potholes to the Everglades, coastal to inland, freshwater to saltwater, but the scope of this methodology is limited to tidal marshes. Salt marshes consist of salt-tolerant and dwarf brushwood vegetation overlying mineral or organic soils.

{8}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

Normal marine environments typically have low sedimentation rates and high  $O<sub>2</sub>$  availability in overlying sediments.

#### Open Water

An area in which water levels do not fall to an elevation that exposes the underlying substrate

#### Organic Soil

Soil with a surface layer of material that has a sufficient depth and percentage of organic carbon to meet thresholds set by the IPCC (Wetlands supplement) for organic soil. Where used in this methodology, the term peat is used to refer to organic soil.

#### Oxygen (O2) Depletion Zone

A Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE) type. This is a depositional environment with low O<sub>2</sub> levels in water overlying sediments due to restricted hydrologic circulation or impaired water quality that leads to hypoxic or anaerobic conditions (including euxinic and semi-euxinic).

#### Salinity Average

The average water salinity value of a wetland ecosystem used to represent variation in salinity during periods of peak CH<sup>4</sup> emissions (e.g., during the growing season in temperate ecosystems)

#### Salinity Low Point

The minimum water salinity value of a wetland ecosystem used to represent variation in salinity during periods of peak CH<sup>4</sup> emissions (e.g., during the growing season in temperate ecosystems)

#### Seagrass Meadow

An accumulation of seagrass plants over a mappable area<sup>2</sup>

#### Small Mountainous River

A Carbon Preservation Depositional Environment (CPDE) type. This is a depositional environment from which the sediment is supplied from small mountainous rivers, most commonly found in tectonically active margins and small steep gradients. Sediment accumulation rates are generally greater than  $0.27$  g sediment per cm<sup>2</sup> per year. Examples of these systems can be found in the rivers flowing from the island of Taiwan and the Eel River of California.

#### Tidal Wetland

A subset of wetlands under the influence of the wetting and drying cycles of the tides (e.g., marshes, seagrass meadows, tidal forested wetlands, and mangroves). Sub-tidal seagrass

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup> This definition includes both the biotic community and the geographic area where the biotic community occurs. Note that the vast majority of seagrass meadows are sub-tidal, but a percentage are intertidal.

{9}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_9_Picture_1.jpeg)

meadows are not subject to drying cycles but are still included in this definition.

#### Tidal Wetland Restoration

Re-establishing or improving the hydrology, salinity, water quality, sediment supply and/or vegetation in degraded or converted tidal wetlands. For the purpose of this methodology, this definition also includes activities that create wetland ecological conditions on uplands under the influence of sea level rise or activities that convert one wetland type to another or activities that convert open water to wetland.

#### Water Table Depth

Depth of sub-soil or above-soil surface of water, relative to the soil surface

#### 5.1.1 Peat depletion time (PDT)

Drained peat is subject to oxidation and subsidence and areas with peat at *t* = 0 may lose all peat before the end of the crediting period. The time at which all peat has disappeared, or at which the peat depth reaches a level where no further oxidation or other losses occur (e.g., at the average water table depth), is referred to as the PDT. Projects that do not quantify reductions of baseline emissions (i.e., those which limit their accounting to GHG removals in biomass and/or soil) need not estimate PDT.

PDT (*t<sub>PDT-BSL,i*)</sub> for a stratum in the baseline scenario limits the period during which the project is eligible to claim soil emission reductions from rewetting, and is estimated at the project start date for each stratum *i* as:

*tPDT-BSL,i* = *Depthpeat,i,t0* / *Ratepeatloss-BSL,I* (1)

If *tPDT-BSL,i* falls within the crediting period, subsequent organic carbon loss from remaining mineral soil may be estimated as well using the procedure for SDT in Section [5.1.2.](#page-12-0)

Organic soil depths, depths of burn scars and subsidence rates must be derived from the data sources described in Section Error! Reference source not found.. Water table depth is assessed, if relevant, following procedures in Section [9.3.11.](#page-112-0)

If *tPDT-BSL,i* falls within the Crediting Period, subsequent organic carbon loss from remaining mineral soil may be estimated as well using the procedure for SDT in Section [5.1.2,](#page-12-0) below.

#### <span id="page-12-0"></span>5.1.2 Soil organic carbon depletion time (SDT)

Projects that do not quantify reductions of baseline emissions (i.e., those which limit their accounting to GHG removals in biomass and/or soil) need not estimate SDT.

SDT (*t<sub>SDT-BSL,i*)</sub> for a stratum in the baseline scenario limits the period during which the project is eligible to claim emission reductions from restoration, and is estimated at the project start date for each stratum *i* as follows:

For strata with eroded soils:

$$
t_{SDT-BSL,i} = 5 \text{ years} \tag{1}
$$

For strata with soils exposed to an aerobic environment through excavation or drainage, use the following equation.

```
tSDT-BSL,i = CBSL,i,t0 / RateCloss-BSL,i (2)
```

| $t_{SDT-BSL,i}$      | = SDT in the baseline scenario in stratum $i$ (in years elapsed since the<br>project start date); yr                                                                                                                    |

| $Rate_{Closs-BSL,i}$ | = Rate of soil organic carbon loss due to oxidation in the baseline scenario<br>in stratum $i$ ; a conservative (high) value must be applied that remains<br>constant over the time from $t = 0$ to SDT; t C ha-1 yr-1. |

The project proponent must determine the depth (*Depthsoil,i,t0* in Equation 12 below) over which *CBSL,i,t0* is determined. Note that a shallower depth will lead to a shorter, and more conservative, SDT. Where SDT is not determined, no reductions of baseline emissions from mineral soil may be claimed.

{13}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

Extrapolation of *RateCloss-BSL,i* over the project crediting period must account for the possibility of a non-linear decrease of soil organic carbon over time, including the tendency of organic carbon concentrations to approach steady-state equilibrium. For this reason, a complete loss of soil organic carbon may not occur in mineral soils. This steady-state equilibrium must be determined conservatively.

In case of alternating mineral and organic horizons, *RateCloss-BSL,i* may be determined for all individual horizons. This also applies to cases where an organic surface layer of less than 10 cm exists or in cases where the soil is classified as organic but its organic matter depletion is expected within the project crediting period and oxidation of organic matter in an underlying mineral soil may occur within this period.

SDT is conservatively set to zero for project sites drained more than 20 years prior to the project start date. SDT is also conservatively set to zero where significant soil erosion occurs in the baseline scenario (*significant* defined as >5% of *RateCloss-BSL,i*).

With respect to the estimation of SDT, the accretion of sediment in the baseline scenario is conservatively excluded.

#### <span id="page-13-0"></span>5.2 Geographic Boundaries

#### $5.2.1$ **General**

The project proponent must define the geographic boundaries of the project area at the beginning of project activities. The project proponent must provide the geographic coordinates of lands (including sub-tidal seagrass areas, where relevant) included in the project area to facilitate accurate delineation of the project area. Remotely sensed data, published topographic maps and data, land administration and tenure records and/or other official documentation that facilitates clear delineation of the project area must be used.

The project activity may contain more than one discrete area of land. Each discrete area of land must have a unique geographical identification.

When describing physical project boundaries, the following information must be provided for each discrete area:

- Name of the project area (including compartment numbers, local name (if any)).
- Unique identifier for each discrete parcel of land.
- Map(s) of the area (preferably in digital format).
- The project area must be geo-referenced and provided in digital format in accordance with VCS rules.
- Total area.
- Details of land rights holder and user rights*.*

#### <span id="page-14-0"></span>5.2.2 Stratification

Where the project area at the project start date is not homogeneous, stratification may be carried out to improve the accuracy and the precision of carbon stock and GHG flux estimates. Where stratification is employed, different stratifications may be required for the baseline and project scenarios in order to achieve optimal accuracy of the estimates of net GHG emission reductions and removals.

Strata may be defined based on soil type and depth (including eligibility as assessed below), water table depth, vegetation cover and/or vegetation composition, salinity, land type (open water, channel, and unvegetated sand or mudflat) or expected changes in these characteristics.

Strata must be spatially discrete and stratum areas must be known. Areas of individual strata must sum to the total project area. Strata must be identified with spatial data (e.g., maps, GIS coverage, classified imagery, sampling grids) from which the area can be determined accurately. Land use/land cover maps in particular must be ground-truthed and less than 10 years old, unless it can be demonstrated that the maps are still accurate. Strata must be discernible taking into account good practice with respect to accuracy requirements for the definition of strata limits and boundaries. The type of spatial data must be indicated and justified in the project description.

The project area may be stratified *ex ante*, and this stratification may be revised *ex post* for monitoring purposes. Established strata may be merged if reasons for their separate establishment are no longer meaningful, or have proven irrelevant to key variables for estimating net GHG emission reductions and removals. Baseline stratification must remain fixed until a reassessment of the baseline scenario occurs. Stratification in the project scenario must be reviewed at each monitoring event prior to verification and revised if necessary.

The sub-sections below specify further requirements and guidance with respect to stratification in certain scenarios.

#### Areas with organic soil

The project proponent must use VCS module *VMD0016 Methods for Stratification of the Project Areas* in order to stratify project areas that include organic soil.

#### Seagrass meadows

Given the tendency of seagrasses to respond differently under different light and depth regimes, the project proponent may differentiate between seagrass meadow sections that occur at different depths given discrete, or relatively abrupt, bathymetric and substrate changes.

For seagrass meadow restoration projects in areas with existing seagrass meadows, the project proponent must quantify the percentage of meadow expansion that can be attributed to the restoration effort but that is not the result of direct planting or seeding. Existing meadows

{15}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_15_Picture_1.jpeg)

(unless smaller in area than 5% of the total project area) must be excluded from the calculation of project emissions, even in cases where the restored meadow enhances carbon sequestration rates in existing meadows.

New seagrass meadows that result from natural expansion must be contiguous with restored meadow plots in order to be included in project accounting, unless the project proponent demonstrates that non-contiguous meadow patches originated from restored meadow seeds. This may be performed via genetic testing or estimated as a percentage of new meadow in noncontiguous plots and observed no less than four years after the project start date. <sup>3</sup> This percentage must not exceed the proportion of restored meadow area relative to the total extent of seagrass meadow areal, and the project proponent must demonstrate the feasibility of current-borne seed dispersal from the restored meadow. In cases where a restored meadow coalesces with an existing meadow(s), the project proponent must delineate the line at which the two meadows are joined. The project proponent may use either aerial observations showing meadow extent or direct field observations.

#### Native ecosystems

In order to claim emission removals from ARR or WRC activities, the project proponent must provide evidence in the project description that the project area was not cleared of native ecosystems to create GHG credits. Such proof is not required where such clearing took place prior to the 10-year period prior to the project start date. Areas that do not meet this requirement must be excluded from the project area.

#### Stratification of vegetation cover for adoption of the default SOC accumulation rate

The default factor for SOC accumulation rate may only be applied to non-seagrass tidal wetland systems with a crown or vegetation cover of at least 15%, with a linearly discounted factor for areas with a crown or vegetation cover of less than 50% (see Sections [8.1.4.2.](#page-32-0)3 and [8.2.4.2.1](#page-54-0)). For the baseline scenario, crown or vegetation covers must be based on a time series of vegetation composition. For the project scenario, crown or vegetation cover mapping must be performed according to established methods in scientific literature.

#### Stratification of salinity for the accounting of $CH<sub>4</sub>$

Tidal wetlands may be stratified according to salinity for the purpose of estimating  $CH_4$ emissions. Threshold values of salinity for mapping salinity strata are specified in Section [8.1.4.5.4.](#page-46-0)

Areas with unrestricted tidal exchange will maintain salinity levels similar to the tidal water source, while those with infrequent tidal flooding will not (in which case the use of channel water salinity levels is not reliable). For such areas it is therefore recommended to stratify according to the frequency of tidal exchange.

<sup>3</sup> McGlathery *et al.* (2012)

{16}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_16_Picture_1.jpeg)

Procedures for the measurement of salinity levels are specified in Section [9.3.8.](#page-108-0)

Stratification of water bodies lacking tidal exchange

The area of ponds, ditches or similar bodies of water within the project area must be measured and treated as separate strata when they do not have surface tidal water exchange.  $CH<sub>4</sub>$ emissions from these features may be excluded from GHG accounting if the area of these features does not increase in the project scenario.

#### $5.2.3$ Sea level rise

When defining geographic project boundaries and strata, the project proponent must consider expected relative sea level rise and the potential for expanding the project area landward to account for wetland migration, inundation and erosion.

For both the baseline and project scenarios, the project proponent must provide a projection of relative sea level rise within the project area based on IPCC regional forecasts or peer-reviewed literature applicable to the region. In addition, the project proponent may also utilize expert judgment<sup>4</sup>. Global average sea level rise scenarios are not suitable for determining the changes in wetlands boundaries. Therefore, if used, IPCC most-likely global sea level rise scenarios must be appropriately downscaled to regional conditions that include vertical land movements, such as subsidence.

Whether degradation occurs in the baseline scenario or restoration occurs in the project scenario, the assessment of potential wetland migration, inundation and erosion with respect to projected sea level rise must account for topographical slope, land use and management, sediment supply and tidal range. The assessment may use published data from the project area, expert judgment or both. Please note that the *VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool* must be used to assess the risk of erosion and inundation caused by sea level rise on carbon stocks in the project scenario.

When assessing the potential for tidal wetlands to migrate horizontally, one must consider the topography of the adjacent land and any migration barriers that may exist. In general, and on coastlines where wetland migration is unimpaired by infrastructure, concave-up slopes may cause 'coastal squeeze', while straight or convex-up gradients are more likely to provide the space required for lateral movement.

The potential for tidal wetlands to rise vertically with sea level rise is sensitive to suspended sediment loads in the system. A sediment load of >300 mg/l has been found to balance highend IPCC scenarios for sea level rise (Orr *et al*. 2003, Stralsburg *et al*. 2011). French (2006) and Morris *et al*. (2012) suggest that the findings of Orr *et al*. 2003 from the San Francisco Bay could be used elsewhere<sup>5</sup>. French (2006) indicates that at 250 mg/l, sea level rise of 15

<sup>4</sup> Requirements for expert judgment are provided in Section [9.3.3.](#page-105-0)

<sup>5</sup> Orr *et al*. 2003, Stralberg *et al*. 2011

{17}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)

mm is balanced at a tidal range of 1 m or greater. Therefore, for marshes with a tidal range greater than 1 m, the project proponent may use >300 mg/l as a sediment load threshold above which wetlands are not predicted to be submerged. The project proponent may use lower threshold values for tidal range and sediment load where justified. The vulnerability of tidal wetlands to sea level rise and conversion to open water is also related to tidal range. In general, the most vulnerable tidal wetlands are those in areas with a small tidal range, those with elevations low in the tidal frame and those in locations with low suspended sediment loads.

The *VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool* must be used to assess the risk of erosion and inundation caused by sea level rise on carbon stocks in the project scenario. In the baseline scenario, the project proponent may conservatively assume that part of the project area submerges, with cessation of GHG removal from the atmosphere as a consequence. If the project is not claiming emissions due to erosion in the baseline scenario, the project proponent may conservatively assume that part of the project area erodes. For areas that submerge without erosion, the loss of SOC may be assumed to be insignificant in both the baseline and project scenarios.

The projection of wetland boundaries within the project area must be presented in maps delineating these boundaries from the project start date until the end of the project crediting period, at intervals appropriate to the rate of change due to sea level rise, and at *t* = 100.

Procedures for estimating the risk of project area submergence due to relative sea level rise are provided in the *VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool*.

#### Estimation of area of eroded strata

Tidal wetlands may be subject to two forms of erosion: a) Seaward edges of wetlands are subject to migration due to changes in local sea level, regional sediment delivery, and impacts of human actions (e.g., nearby excavation of shipping channels); b) In sheltered settings, away from open shores, wetlands may also erode internally through channel enlargement if sediment supply for wetland accretion is insufficient to keep pace with sea-level rise.

Projections of future erosion must take into account scaling of wetland retreat against projections of accelerated sea-level rise, any modification to sediment supply and human action.

Channel densities (surface area of channel per surface area of wetland) greater than 20% and/or changes in wetland vegetation consistent with increased duration or depth of flooding is an indication that the wetland may not be keeping pace with sea level. Similarly, a decline in surface elevation relative to a datum of mean high water surface spring elevation in the interior of the tidal wetland is an indication of wetland sensitivity to sediment supply under conditions of sea-level rise. Sites with an annual average suspended sediment load in flooding waters of >300 mg/l may be considered resilient to sea-level rise in terms of surface accretion. The project proponent should take into account these indicators of wetland potential sensitivity to

{18}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_18_Picture_0.jpeg)

sea-level rise when considering whether to extend the eroded area strata to include marsh interior.

Because such projections are driven by conditions specific to individual project settings, expert knowledge from an experienced geomorphologist / coastal engineer must be utilized for complex projects.

#### <span id="page-18-4"></span> $5.2.4$ Ineligible wetland areas

For projects quantifying  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emission reductions, project areas which do not achieve a significant difference ( $\geq$  5%) in cumulative carbon loss over a period of 100 years beyond the project start date are not eligible for crediting based on the reduction of baseline emissions, and these areas must be mapped.

The maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions which may be claimed from the soil carbon pool is limited to the difference between the remaining soil organic carbon stock in the project and baseline scenarios after 100 years (total stock approach), or the difference in cumulative soil organic carbon loss in both scenarios over a period of 100 years since the project start date (stock loss approach). The project proponent must calculate this maximum quantity *ex ante* using conservative parameters and following one of the options below.

#### 1. Total stock approach

The difference between soil organic carbon stock in the project scenario and baseline scenario at *t* = 100 is estimated as:

$$
C_{WPS-BSL,t100} = \sum_{i=0}^{M_{WPS}} \left( C_{WPS,i} \times A_{WPS,i,t100} \right) - \sum_{i=0}^{M_{BSL}} \left( C_{BSL,i,t100} \times A_{BSL,i,t100} \right) \tag{3}
$$

*CWPS*,*i*,*t*<sup>100</sup> requires no adjustment for leakage since the applicability conditions of this methodology are structured to ensure leakage emissions do not occur, as explained in Section 8.3.

The difference between organic carbon stock in the project scenario and baseline scenario at  $t = 100$  (*C<sub>WPS-BSL,t100*) is significant if:</sub>

<span id="page-18-3"></span>
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M_{WPS}} (C_{WPS,i,t100} \times A_{WPS,i,t00}) \ge 1.05 \times \sum_{i=0}^{M_{BSL}} (C_{BSL,i,t100} \times A_{BSL,i,t100})
$$
(4)

<span id="page-18-1"></span>For organic soil:

 $C_{WPS,i,t100} = Depth_{peak\text{-}WPS,i,t100} \times VC \times 10$  (6)

<span id="page-18-2"></span> $C_{BSL,i,t100} = Depth_{peak-BSL,i,t100} \times VC \times 10$  (7)

<span id="page-18-0"></span> $Depth_{peak-BSL,i,t,100}=Depth_{peak,i,t,0}-\sum_{t=1}^{t=100}Rate_{peatloss-BSL,i,t}$ (8)

{19}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-19-0"></span>
$$
Depth_{peak-WPS,i,t,100} = Depth_{peak,i,t,0} - \sum_{t=1}^{t=100} Rate_{peatloss-WPS,i,t}
$$
\n(9)

For mineral soil:

<span id="page-19-2"></span>
$$
C_{BSL,i,t100} = C_{BSL,i,t0} - \sum_{t=1}^{t=100} Rate_{\text{closs} - BSL,i,t}
$$
\n(1.0)

$$
C_{WPS,i,t100} = C_{BSL,i,t0} - \sum_{t=1}^{t=100} Rate_{\text{closs-WPS},i,t}
$$
\n(11)

<span id="page-19-5"></span>
$$
C_{BSL,i,t0} = Depthsoil,i,t0 \times VC \times 10
$$
\n(12)

Where a conservative constant rate of subsidence or carbon loss is applied, a possible negative outcome must be substituted by zero.

The carbon content of organic or mineral soil may be taken from measurements within the project area, or from literature involving the project area or similar areas.

#### 2. Stock loss approach

The project proponent may also calculate the maximum quantity based on cumulative soil organic carbon loss up to *t* = 100 as follows:

<span id="page-19-6"></span>
$$
C_{WPS-BSL,t,100} = \sum_{i=1}^{M_{BSL}} (C_{loss-BSL,i,t100} \times A_{BSL,i}) - \sum_{i=1}^{M_{WPS}} (C_{loss-WPS,i,t,100} \times A_{WPS,i})
$$
(13)

<span id="page-19-1"></span>For organic soil:

$$
C_{loss-BSL,t,100} = 10 \times \sum_{i=1}^{100} (Rate_{peattloss-BSL,i,t} \times VC)
$$
\n(14)

$$
C_{loss-WPS,t,100} = 10 \times \sum_{i=1}^{100} (Rate_{peatloss-WPS,i,t} \times VC)
$$
\n(15)

For mineral soil:

<span id="page-19-4"></span><span id="page-19-3"></span>
$$
C_{loss-BSL,t,100} = 10 \times \sum_{i=1}^{100} (Rate_{\text{Closs-BSL},i,t} \times VC) \tag{16}
$$

$$
C_{loss-WPS,t,100} = 10 \times \sum_{i=1}^{100} (Rate_{\text{Closs-WPS},i,t} \times VC) \tag{17}
$$

#### 5.2.5 Buffer zones

Where established, buffer zones must be mapped in accordance with the VCS rules.

#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>5.3 Carbon Pools

The carbon pools included in and excluded from the project boundary are shown in Table 1 below.

Carbon pools may be deemed *de minimis* and do not need to be accounted for if together the omitted decrease in carbon stocks or increase in GHG emissions (Table 2) amounts to less than 5% of the total GHG benefit generated by the project. Peer reviewed literature or the CDM tool *AR-Tool04 Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities* may be used to determine whether decreases in carbon pools are *de minimis*.

This tool has been designed for CDM A/R project activities, and is used in this methodology noting the following:

| Where the tool refers to:                         | It must be understood as referring to: |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A/R, afforestation, reforestation, or forestation | WRC or WRC/ARR, or restoration         |
| Net greenhouse gas removals by sinks              | Net greenhouse gas emission reductions |
| CDM                                               | VCS                                    |
| DOE                                               | VVB                                    |
| tCERs, lCERs                                      | VCUs                                   |

Since projects using this methodology are eligible to apply the activity method for demonstrating additionality (see Section 7.1 below), all elements of the tool related to additionality must be disregarded.

#### <span id="page-23-2"></span>6.2 Reassessment of the Baseline Scenario

The project proponent must reassess the baseline scenario in accordance with the VCS rules.

For this reassessment, when applying the *Fire Reduction Premium* approach specified in Section [8.3,](#page-57-0) the historic reference period must be extended to include the original reference period and all subsequent monitoring periods up to the beginning of the current monitoring period. The fire reference period must not be extended, as this is a fixed 10-year period ending 5 years before the project start date.

In addition, the project proponent must, for the duration of the project, re-determine, where applicable, the PDT every 10 years. This reassessment must use the procedure specified in Section Error! Reference source not found.. Data sources must be updated where new information relevant to the project area has become available.

### 8.1 Baseline Emissions

#### 8.1.1 General approach

Emissions in the baseline scenario are attributed to carbon stock changes in biomass carbon pools, soil processes, or a combination of these. In addition, where relevant, emissions from fossil fuel use may be quantified.

Emissions in the baseline scenario are estimated as:

$$
GHG_{BSL} = GHG_{BSL-biomass} + GHG_{BSL-soil} + GHG_{BSL-fuel}
$$
\n(18)

$$
GHG_{BSL-biomass} = -\sum_{t=1}^{t^*} \sum_{i=1}^{M_{BSL}} \left(\frac{44}{12} \times \Delta C_{BSL-biomass,i,t}\right)
$$
\n
$$
(19)
$$

$$
GHG_{BSL-biomass} = \sum_{t=1}^{t^*} \sum_{i=1}^{M_{BSL}} GHG_{BSL-soil,i,t}
$$
\n
$$
(20)
$$

$$
GHG_{BSL-fuel} = \sum_{t=1}^{t^*} \sum_{i=1}^{M_{BSL}} GHG_{BSL-fuel,i,t}
$$
\n(21)

Where:

| GHGBSL            | = Net CO2e emissions in the baseline scenario up to year t*; t CO2e                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GHGBSL-biomass    | = Net CO2e emissions from biomass carbon pools in the baseline scenario up to<br>year t*; t CO2e                               |
| GHGBSL-soil       | = Net CO2e emissions from the SOC pool in the baseline scenario up to year t*;<br>CO2e                                         |
| GHGBSL-fuel       | = Net CO2e emissions from fossil fuel use in the baseline scenario up to year<br>t*; t CO2e                                    |
| ΔCBSL-biomass,i,t | = Net carbon stock changes in biomass carbon pools in the baseline scenario<br>in stratum <i>i</i> in year <i>t</i> ; t C yr-1 |
| GHGBSL-soil,i,t   | = GHG emissions from the SOC pool in the baseline scenario in stratum <i>i</i> in<br>year t; t CO2e yr-1                       |

|                      | tCO2e yr-1                                                                                      |
| i =                  | 1, 2, 3 ...MBSL strata in the baseline scenario                                                 |
| t =                  | 1, 2, 3, ... t* years elapsed since the project start date                                      |

Estimation of GHG emissions and removals related to the biomass pool is based on carbon stock changes. Estimation of GHG emissions and removals from the SOC pool is based on either various proxies (e.g., carbon stock change, water table depth) or through the use of literature, data, default factors or models.

Assessing GHG emissions in the baseline scenario consists of determining GHG emission proxies/parameters and assessing their pre-project spatial distribution, constructing a time series of the chosen proxies/parameters for each stratum for the entire project crediting period and determining annual GHG emissions per stratum for the entire project crediting period.

In order to project the future GHG emissions per unit area in each stratum for each projected verification date within the project crediting period under the baseline scenario, the project proponent must apply the latest version of VCS module *VMD0019 Methods to Project Future Conditions*. <sup>6</sup> When applying Steps 13 and 14 of *VMD0019* (version 1, issued 16 November 2012, the version of the module current as of the writing of this methodology) the project proponent must use the guidance for sea level rise provided in Section [5.2](#page-13-0) of this methodology.

Four driving factors are likely to be relevant for GHG accounting in the baseline scenario, and are relevant for use of *VMD0019*. Each factor affects the evolution of the site over a 100-year period. These include:

- Initial land use and development patterns
- Initial infrastructure that impedes natural tidal hydrology
- Natural plant succession for the physiographic region of the project
- Climate variables as likely drivers of changes in tidal hydrology within the 100-year timeframe of the project, influencing sea level rise, precipitation and associated freshwater delivery

Land use and development patterns - In order to derive trends in land use, assumptions about the likelihood of future development of the project area must be documented and considered in light of current zoning, regulatory constraints to development, proximity to urban areas or transportation infrastructure, and expected population growth, including how land would

<sup>6</sup> This module provides detailed procedures for assessing future trends in key variables that affect GHG emissions or removals. In the context of this methodology, this module is meant to assist in the assessment of these trends and does not necessarily replace procedures in this methodology. Procedures in the module must be used whenever relevant and may be justifiably simplified.

{26}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)

develop within and surrounding the project site and how such changes would change hydrologic conditions within the project area. Current development patterns and plausible future land use changes must be mapped to a scale sufficient to estimate GHG emissions from the baseline scenario. Particular attention must be paid to existing or future construction of barriers to tidal and/or river hydrology and sediment supply from rivers and/or along the coast, as well as barriers that will impair wetland capacity to migrate landwards with sea level rise. In the case of abandonment of pre-project land use in the baseline scenario, the project proponent must consider non-human induced hydrologic changes brought about by collapsing dikes or ditches that would have naturally closed over time, and progressive subsidence, leading to rising relative water levels, increasingly thinner aerobic layers and reduced  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emission rates.

Infrastructure impediments to tidal hydrology – In order to derive trends in tidal wetland evolution, the baseline scenario must take into account the current and historic layout of any tidal barriers and drainage systems. The tidal barriers and drainage layout at the start of the project activity must be mapped at scale (1:10,000 or any other scale justified for estimating water table depths throughout the project area). Historic tidal barriers and drainage layout must be mapped using topographic and/or hydrological maps from (if available) the start of the major hydrological impacts but covering at least the 20 years prior to the project start date. Historic drainage structures (collapsed ditches) may (still) have higher hydraulic conductivity than the surrounding areas and function as preferential flow paths. Historic tidal barriers (agricultural dikes and levees) may constrain the tidal flows and prevent natural sedimentation patterns. The effect of historic tidal barriers and drainage structures on current hydrological functioning of the project area must be assessed on the basis of quantitative hydrological modeling and/or expert judgment.

Historic information on the pre-existing channel network as determined by aerial photography may serve to set trends in post-project dendritic channel formation in the field. Derivation of such trends must be performed on the basis of hydrologic modeling using the total tidal volume, soil erodibility and/or expert judgment. With respect to hydrological functioning, the baseline scenario must be restricted by climate variables and quantify any impacts on the hydrological functioning as caused by planned measures outside the project area (e.g., dam construction or further changes in hydrology such as culverts), by demonstrating a hydrological connection to the planned measures.

Natural plant succession - Based on the assessment of changes in water table depth, a time series of vegetation composition must be derived *ex ante*, based on vegetation succession schemes in the baseline scenario from scientific literature or expert judgment. For example, diked agricultural land will undergo natural plant succession to forests, freshwater wetlands, tidal wetlands, rank uplands, or open water based on the scenario's land use trajectory, inundation scenario, proximity to native or invasive seed sources, plant succession trajectories of adjacent natural areas or likely maintenance consistent with projected future human land use (e.g., pasture, lawn, landscaping).

{27}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

Climate variables – Consistent with the sea level rise guidance provided in Section [5.2](#page-13-0) above, areas of inundation and erosion within the project area must be considered in relation to the above three factors. Expected changes in freshwater delivery associated with changes in rainfall patterns must be considered, including expected human responses to these changes.

The project proponent must, for the duration of the project crediting period, reassess the baseline scenario every 10 years. Based on the reassessment criteria specified in Section 6 above, the revised baseline scenario must be incorporated into revised estimates of baseline emissions. This baseline reassessment must include the evaluation of the validity of proxies for GHG emissions.

#### 8.1.2 Accounting for sea level rise

The consequences of submergence of a given stratum due to sea level rise are:

- 1) Carbon stocks from aboveground biomass are lost to oxidation, and
- 2) Depending upon the geomorphic setting, soil carbon stocks may be held intact or be eroded and transported beyond the project area.

For strata where conversion to open water is expected before *t* = 100, the maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions that may be claimed by the project must be calculated as defined in Section [8.5.1.](#page-59-1)

Regarding (1) above, where biomass is submerged, it is assumed that this carbon is immediately and entirely returned to the atmosphere. For such strata:

$$
\Delta C_{BSL\text{-}agbiomass,i,t} = 12/44 \times (C_{BSL\text{-}agbiomass,i,t} - C_{BSL\text{-}agbiomass,i,(t-T)}) / T
$$
 (22)

For the year of submergence:

 $C_{BSL-agbiomass,i,t} = 0$ 

Where:

| $             \Delta C_{BSL-agbiomass,i,t}         $ | = Net carbon stock change in aboveground biomass carbon pools in the baseline<br>scenario in stratum <i>i</i> in year <i>t</i> ; t C yr-1                                                                                                  |

| t                                                    | = 1, 2, 3, ... t* years elapsed since the project start date                                                                                                                                                                               |
| T                                                    | = Time elapsed between two successive estimations ( <i>T</i> = <i>t</i> 2 - <i>t</i> 1)                                                                                                                                                    |

The gradual loss of vegetation in the project area due to submergence may be captured by detailed stratification into areas with and without vegetation.

{28}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)

Regarding (2) above, the project proponent must assess the time and rate of submergence of the project area.

For areas that drown out while the area of ponds increases, the loss of SOC may be assumed to be insignificant. It is assumed that, upon submergence, soil carbon is not returned to the atmosphere unless site-specific scientific justification is provided.

In areas with wave action, sediment will erode, and carbon will be removed. Assuming that all carbon is re-sedimented and stored (and not oxidized) is conservative. Procedure for  $CO<sub>2</sub>$ emissions from eroded soil are provided in Section [8.1.4.3.](#page-40-0)

Restoration projects may be designed in such a way that they have advantages over the baseline scenario in one or more of the following ways, as must be quantified and justified in the project description:

- The point in time when submergence and erosion sets off.
- The amount of carbon that erodes upon submergence.
- The oxidation rate of eroded soil organic matter. In the most conservative approach, the oxidation constant is 0 for the baseline and 1 for the project scenario.

#### 8.1.3 Net carbon stock change in biomass carbon pools in baseline scenario

Net carbon stock change in biomass carbon pools in the baseline scenario are estimated as:

$$
\Delta C_{BSL\text{-}biomass,i,t} = \Delta C_{BSL\text{-}tree/shrub,i,t} + \Delta C_{BSL\text{-}herb,i,t}
$$
\n

Where:

#### Trees and shrubs

Net carbon stock change in trees and shrubs in the baseline scenario are estimated by applying the latest version of CDM tool *AR-Tool14 Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities*, noting that:

1) *AR-Tool14* is only used to derive net carbon stock changes in tree and shrub carbon pools (Δ*CBSL-tree/shrub,i,t*), and

{29}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_29_Picture_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-29-0"></span>2) The following equation applies:

$$
\Delta C_{BSL\text{-}tree/shrub,i,t} = 12/44 \times (\Delta C_{TREE\_BSL,t} + \Delta C_{SHRUB\_BSL,t})
$$
\n(24)

Where:

| $    \Delta C_{\text{BSL-tree/shrub},i,t}   $ | = Net carbon stock changes in tree and shrub carbon pools in the baseline<br>scenario in stratum <i>i</i> in year <i>t</i> ; t C yr-1                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $\Delta C_{\text{TREE\_BSL},t}$               | = Change in carbon stock in baseline tree biomass within the project area in<br>year <i>t</i> ; t CO2-e yr-1 (derived from application of AR- <i>Tool14</i> ; calculations are<br>done for each stratum <i>i</i> )  |

For strata where reforestation or revegetation activities in the baseline scenario include harvesting, the long-term average of *CTREE\_BSL,t* in *AR-Tool14* must be calculated as specified in Section [8.2.3.](#page-50-0)

#### Herbaceous vegetation

Net carbon stock change in herbaceous vegetation in the baseline scenario is estimated using a carbon stock change approach as follows:

<span id="page-29-1"></span>
$$
\Delta C_{BSL\text{-}herb,i,t} = (C_{BSL\text{-}herb,i,t} - C_{BSL\text{-}herb,i,,(t-T)}) / T

#### Where:

| $         \Delta C_{BSL-herb,i,t}       $ | = Net carbon stock change in herbaceous vegetation carbon pools in the                                      |

| $C_{BSL-herb,i,t}$                        | = Carbon stock in herbaceous vegetation in the baseline scenario in stratum <i>i</i> in year <i>t</i> ; t C |

A default factor<sup>7</sup> for carbon stock in herbaceous vegetation of 3 t C ha-1 may be applied for strata with 100% herbaceous cover. For areas with a vegetation cover <100%, a 1:1 relationship between vegetation cover and carbon stock must be applied. The default factor may be claimed only for the first year of the project crediting period as herbaceous biomass

<sup>7</sup> Calculated from peak aboveground biomass data from 20 sites summarized in Mitsch & Gosselink. The median of these studies is 1.3 kg d.m. m<sup>.2</sup>. This was converted to the default factor value as follows: 1.3 × 0.45 × 0.5. The factor 0.45 converts organic matter mass to carbon mass; the factor 0.5 is a factor that averages annual peak biomass (factor = 1) and annual minimum biomass (factor = 0, assuming ephemeral aboveground biomass and complete litter decomposition).

quickly reaches a steady state. Vegetation cover must be determined by commonly used techniques in field biology. Procedures for measuring carbon stocks in herbaceous vegetation are provided in Section [9.3.6.](#page-107-0) The above default factor may not be applied in case *AR-Tool14* is used.

Where a carbon stock increase in herbaceous vegetation is quantified in the project scenario, carbon stock changes must also be quantified in the baseline scenario; where a carbon stock decline is quantified in the baseline scenario, carbon stock changes must also be quantified in the project scenario.

GHG emissions from disturbed carbon stocks in stockpiles (originating from piling, dredging, channelization) exposed to aerobic decomposition must be accounted for in the baseline scenario. Such stockpiles must be identified in the stratification of the project area and accounting procedures provided in this Section [8.1.4](#page-30-0) must be used.

The baseline scenario may involve the construction of levees to constrain flow and flooding patterns, the construction of dams to hold water, and/or upstream changes in land surface leading to intensified run-off. In such cases, the project proponent must account for hydrological processes that lead to increased carbon burial and GHG reductions within the project area using procedures provided in this section.

The sub-sections below provide guidance with respect to the methods which may be used to estimate net GHG emissions from soil in the baseline scenario. Project proponents may choose the method that is most suitable to their project circumstances and data availability. However, default factors and emissions factors cannot be used in the presence of published data suitable for use in the project area.

#### Use of proxies

Proxies (as defined in VCS document *Program Definitions*) may be used to derive values of GHG emissions. The project proponent must demonstrate that such proxies are strongly correlated with the value of interest and that they can serve as an equivalent or better method (e.g., in

{32}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)

terms of reliability, consistency or practicality) to determine the value of interest than direct measurement of the value itself. Such proxies must also have been developed and tested for use in systems that are in the same or similar region as the project area, share similar geomorphic, hydrologic, and biological properties, and are under similar management regimes, unless any differences should not have a substantial effect on GHG emissions.

#### Use of models

The project proponent may apply deterministic models (models as defined in VCS document *Program Definitions*) to derive values of GHG emissions. In addition to the VCS requirements for selection and use of models, modeled GHG emissions and removals must have been validated with direct measurements from a system with the same or similar water table depth and dynamics, salinity, tidal hydrology, sediment supply and plant community type as the project area.

#### Use of published data

Peer-reviewed published data or scientific reports that have been scrutinized under the rules for expert judgment (Section [9.3.3\)](#page-105-0) may be used to generate values for GHG emissions in the same or similar systems as those in the project area. Such data must be limited to systems that are in the same or similar region as the project area, share similar geomorphic, hydrologic, and biological properties, and are under similar management regimes unless any differences should not have a substantial effect on GHG emissions.

#### Use of default factors

Emission factors must be derived from peer-reviewed literature and must be appropriate to ecosystem type and conditions and the geographic region of the project area.

The default factors in Sections [8.1.4.2.3,](#page-35-0) [8.1.4.5.4,](#page-46-0) and [8.1.4.6.4](#page-48-0) are subject to periodic reassessment per the requirements for periodic assessment of default factors set out in VCS document *Methodology Development and Review Process*.

IPCC default factors<sup>8</sup> may be used as indicated in this methodology. Tier 1 values may be used, where relevant indicated in the procedures below, but their use must be justified as appropriate for project conditions.

#### <span id="page-32-0"></span>CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from soil – *in situ*

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from *in-situ* soil exposed to an aerobic environment through drainage (*GHGBSLinsitu-CO2,i,t*) may be calculated directly or may be calculated from estimates of the initial amount of carbon that is exposed (*CBSL-soil,i,t*) and the percentage of the exposed carbon that is returned to the atmosphere (*C%BSL-emitted,i,t*) as defined in Equation 28.

<sup>8</sup> 2013 Supplement to the 2006 Guidelines: Wetlands

{33}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_33_Picture_0.jpeg)

Estimates of *CBSL-soil,i,t* or *C%BSL-emitted,i,* following aerobic exposure based on the extrapolation of *C%BSL-emitted,i,t* over the project crediting period must account for tendency of organic carbon concentrations to approach steady-state equilibrium in mineral soils. For this reason, a complete loss of soil organic carbon may not occur in mineral soils. Likewise, *C%BSL-emitted,i,* may not reach 100%. This steady-state equilibrium must be determined conservatively, e.g. by assuming that *CBSL-soil,i,t* at steady state will be zero or that *C%BSL-emitted,i,* will be 100%. In case of alternating mineral and organic horizons that are exposed,  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions must be determined for all individual horizons.

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from soils may be estimated using:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Published values
- 3) Default factors
- 4) Models

In certain cases, allochthonous soil organic carbon may accumulate in the project area. Procedures for the estimation of a compensation factor for allochthonous soil organic carbon are specified in Section [8.1.4.2.7.](#page-37-0)

<span id="page-33-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.2.1 Proxy-based approach

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions may be estimated using proxies such as water table depth and soil subsidence (where such proxies meet the guidance in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above). Carbon stock change, as a

{34}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_34_Picture_0.jpeg)

proxy for CO<sup>2</sup> emissions or removals, is dealt with in Section [8.1.4.2.5.](#page-36-0) Where the project proponent uses a proxy, such emissions are represented by the following equation:

*GHGBSL-soil-CO2,i,t* = ƒ (GHG emission proxy) (30)

#### Water table depth

Water table depth may be used as a proxy for  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions for mineral and organic soils where the project proponent is able to justify their use as described in Section [8.1.4.1.](#page-30-1)

When using water table depth as a proxy, it must be projected for the 10-year baseline period through hydrologic modeling, taking into consideration the following:

- Long-term average climate variables (over 20+ years prior to the project start date from two climate stations nearest to the project area) influencing water levels and the timing and quantity of water flow;
- Planned water management activities documented in existing land management plans, predating consideration of the proposed project activity; and
- Potential offsite influences (e.g., changes in sedimentation rates, upstream water supply, sea level rise).

If the mean annual water table depth in the project area exceeds the depth range for which the emission-water table depth relationship determined for the project is valid, a conservative extrapolation must be used.

#### **Subsidence**

Soil subsidence may also be used as a proxy for  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from the SOC pool, using the equation below:

| $GHG_{BSL-soil-CO2,i,t} = 44/12 \times C_{peatloss-BSL,i,t}$ | (31) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|

<span id="page-34-0"></span> $C_{\text{peatloss-BSL},i,t} = 10 \times \text{Rate}_{\text{subs-BSL},i} \times \text{VC}$  (32)

<span id="page-35-1"></span>

##### 8.1.4.2.2 Published values

Peer-reviewed published data may be used to generate a value for *GHGBSL-insitu-CO2,i,t , CBSL-soil,i,t* , *C%BSL-emiitted,i,t* , *C%BSL-soil,i,t* , *BD* or *Depth*, based on values from the same or similar systems as those in the project area, based on the guidelines in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above.

<span id="page-35-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.2.3 Default factors

For tidal marsh and mangrove systems, a default factor for *GHGBSL-insitu-CO2,i,t* may be used in the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach, using the value provided below:

$$
GHG_{BSL-institu-CO2,i,t} = -1.46^{(9)} t C ha^{-1} yr^{-1} \times 44/12
$$
 (33)

The above default factor may only be applied to areas with a crown or vegetation cover of at least 50%. By contrast, for areas with a crown or vegetation cover of less than 15%, this SOC accumulation is assumed to be insignificant and accounted for as zero. For areas with a crown or vegetation cover between 15 and 50%, a linear interpolation may be applied.

When using this default factor, a deduction for allochthonous carbon must be applied as per Section [8.1.4.2.7.](#page-37-0)

In the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach, the most recently published IPCC emission factors<sup>10</sup> may be used to estimate  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from the SOC pool, except for tidal marsh and mangrove systems*.*

A default factor may be used for mineral soils for the percent carbon at a steady-state equilibrium attained 20 years following exposure to an aerobic environment in the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach, i.e., at steady state:

```
C%BSL-soil,i,t = C%BSL-soil,i,t20 (34)
```

<span id="page-35-2"></span>(34)

#### Where:

| $C\%_{BSL-soil,i,t}$   | = Percentage of carbon of <i>in-situ</i> soil material in stratum <i>i</i> in year <i>t</i> ; %                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $C\%_{BSL-soil,i,t20}$ | = Percentage of carbon in <i>in-situ</i> soil material at steady-state equilibrium 20 years following exposure to an aerobic environment in stratum <i>i</i> in year 20; % |

<sup>9</sup> (within Equation 34) This default factor was derived from the median rate of the literature synthesis of Chmura et al. 2003. The synthesis included studies worldwide, including marshes and mangroves. The median was used as the best estimate of central tendency because the data were not normally distributed.

<span id="page-36-3"></span><span id="page-36-2"></span>(35)

The project proponent may assume that percent carbon declines from the initial value ( $C\%_{BSL}$ *soil,i,t0*) (derived through field data collection, or other methods in this section) to the following default steady-state equilibrium at a linear rate over a twenty year period following exposure.

 $C\%$ *BSL-soil,i,t20* = 1.6 %  $(11)$ 

The project proponent may justify a lower percent carbon steady state for the baseline scenario based on appropriate scientific research.

##### 8.1.4.2.4 Modeling

A peer-reviewed published model may be used to generate a value of *GHGBSL-insitu-CO2,i,t* , *CBSLsoil,i,t* , *C%BSL-emitted,i,t,*, *C%BSL-soil,i,t* , *BD or Depth* in the same or similar systems as those in the project area based on the guidelines in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above*.*

<span id="page-36-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.2.5 Field-collected data

Soil coring may be used to generate a value of *CBSL-soil,i,t*, *C%BSL-soil,i,t* , *BD* or *Depth* as outlined in Section [9.3.7.](#page-107-1) For the baseline scenario, soil cores must be collected within 2 years prior to the project start date. Where the project proponent uses an installed reference plane for the baseline scenario, it must have been installed at least 4 years prior to the baseline measurement, which is good practice to ensure that a reliable average accumulation rate is obtained.

Carbon stock change based on field-collected data is calculated using the following equation:

$$
GHG_{BSL\text{-}soil\text{-}CO2,i,t} = 44/12 \times -(C_{BSL\text{-}soil,i,t} - C_{BSL\text{-}soil,i,(t-T)}) / T

*GHGBSL-insitu-CO2,i,t* , *CBSL-soil,i,t* , *C%BSL-emitted,i,t* , *BD* or *Depth* in the baseline scenario may be estimated using either historical data collected from the project area or chronosequence data collected at similar sites. Refer to the instructions in Section 8.1.4.1.

<sup>11</sup> This is the mean value of resampled cultivated and drained mineral soils (from Table 2 in David *et al*. 2009).

As an example, the rate of soil organic carbon loss due to oxidation in the baseline scenario from mineral soils (*RateCloss-BSL*) may be estimated using either historical data collected from the project area (as described in Section [9.3.7\)](#page-107-1) or chronosequence data collected at similar sites (as described in Section [8.1.4.1\)](#page-30-1). Refer also to the instructions in Section Error! Reference source not found..  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from the SOC pool are then calculated as follows:

##### 8.1.4.2.7 Deduction for allochthonous carbon

A deduction from the estimate of  $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from the SOC pool must be applied to account for the percentage of sequestration resulting from allochthonous soil organic carbon accumulation. A deduction must not be used if the approach used above to estimate  $CO<sub>2</sub>$ emissions directly estimates autochthonous CO<sub>2</sub> emissions or otherwise accounts for allochthonous carbon.

*Deductionalloch* may be conservatively set to zero in the baseline scenario.

For strata with organic soils or seagrass systems14, *Deductionalloch* = 0.

*%Calloch* may be estimated using either:

- 1) Published values
- 2) Field-collected data
- 3) Modeling

#### Published values

Peer-reviewed published data may be used to generate a value of the percentage of allochthonous soil organic carbon in the same or similar systems as those in the project area based on the guidelines described in Section [8.1.4.1.](#page-30-1)

For example, *Needelman et al. (2018)* provide a value for the p*ercentage* of the total soil organic carbon that is allochthonous (*%Calloch*) based on the percentage soil carbon, which can be used for marshes and mangroves with mineral soils.

#### Field-collected data

For this method, the allochthonous carbon percentage is estimated using default values (listed below) and measured through analysis of field-collected soil cores (for soil carbon or organic matter), sediment tiles (for deposited sediment carbon or organic matter), or through collection of suspended sediments in tidal channels or sediments deposits in tidal flats (for sediment carbon or organic matter).

For the following equation, %C<sub>soil</sub> may be measured directly or derived from %OM<sub>soil</sub> using the equations in Section [9.3.7.](#page-107-1) %C<sub>autoch</sub> is derived from %OM<sub>autoch</sub> (defined below) using the equations in Section [9.3.7.](#page-107-1)

 $\%C_{\text{alloc}} = 100 \times (\%C_{\text{soil}} - \%C_{\text{autoch}}) / \%C_{\text{soil}}$  (39)

| %Cautoch | = Percentage of soil that is autochthonous organic carbon; %           |

*For the following equation, %OMsoil* may be estimated directly using loss-on-ignition (LOI) data or indirectly from *%Csoil* using the equations below. *%OMdepsed* may be estimated directly using

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>14</sup> For seagrass systems, this zero deduction may only be used when the 'layer with soil organic carbon indistinguishable from the baseline SOC concentration' method is used with field-collected data on carbon stock changes (Duarte 2013, Greinier *et al*. 2013)

The following equations may be used to derive %OMsoil from %C<sub>soil</sub> and %OMdepsed from %Cdepsed, respectively. Alternatively, an equation developed using site-specific data may be used or an equation from peer-reviewed literature may be used if the equation represents soils from the same or similar systems as those in the project area.

For marsh soils*15*:

<span id="page-39-0"></span>
$$
\% \text{OM}_{\text{soil}} = (-0.4 + \sqrt{(0.4^2 + 4 \times 0.0025 \times \% C_{\text{soil}})}/(2 \times 0.0025) \tag{41}
$$

$$

#### Modeling

A quantitative model may be used to estimate the percent of allochthonous soil organic carbon where such model meets the guidelines in Section 8.1.4.1 above. The modeled percentage allochthonous soil organic carbon must be verified with direct measurements from a system with similar water table depth and dynamics, salinity and plant community type as the project area. The model must be accepted by the scientific community as shown by publication in a peer-reviewed journal and repeated application to different wetland systems.

<span id="page-40-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.3 CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Eroded Soil

For each stratum *i* at time *t* the project proponent must determine if soil erosion occurs.

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from eroded soil material (*GHGBSL-eroded-CO2,i,t*) may be calculated directly or may be calculated from estimates of the amount of carbon that is eroded (*CBSL-eroded,i,t*) and the percentage of the eroded carbon that is returned to the atmosphere (*C%BSL-emitted,i,t*).

Project proponents can use any combination of the following methods to calculate these terms:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Published values
- 3) Default factors
- 4) Models
- 5) Field-collected data, or
- <span id="page-40-1"></span>6) Historical or chronosequence-derived data

###### 8.1.4.3.1 Proxy-based approach

 $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from eroded soil may be estimated using proxies (where such proxies meet the guidance in Section 8.1.4.1). Where the project proponent uses a proxy, such emissions are represented by the following equation:

<span id="page-41-2"></span>

|  | $GHG_{BSL-eroded-CO2,i,t} = f$ (GHG emission proxy) | (50) |
|--|-----------------------------------------------------|------|
|--|-----------------------------------------------------|------|

###### 8.1.4.3.2 Published values

Peer-reviewed published data may be used to generate a value for GHG<sub>*BSL-eroded-CO2,i,t*, CBSL-</sub> *eroded,i,t , C%BSL-emiitted,i,t , C%BSL-eroded,i,t , BD or Depth,* based on values from same or similar systems as those in the project area, based on the guidelines in Section 8.1.4.1.

<span id="page-41-1"></span>

###### 8.1.4.3.3 Default factors

For tidal marsh and mangrove systems, a default factor may be used in the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach, using the values provided below for the specified carbon preservation depositional environment (CPDE) as defined in Chapter 3:

If there is connectivity between the eroded area and a river-estuary system:<sup>21 22</sup>

<span id="page-41-0"></span>If CPDE is "Normal Marine" or "Deltaic fluidized muds", then *C%BSL-emitted,i,t =* 80% (51)

If CPDE is "O<sup>2</sup> depletion", then *C%BSL-emitted,i,t =* 53% (52)

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>20</sup> To ensure a conservative outcome, emissions must be estimated for a 5-year time period following the initial year of erosion.

<sup>21</sup> Connectivity occurs when eroded carbon is delivered into river-estuary systems that transport materials seaward by continual resuspension, coastal margins and embayments with sufficient wave energy to continually re-suspend sediments into an aerobic water column, or subaquatic environments with low organic carbon content and coursegrained sediments that maintain aerobic conditions in the upper soil profile.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>22</sup> Values below are from Blair and Aller 2012

{42}------------------------------------------------

| If CPDE is "Small Mountainous Rivers", then $C\%_{BSLemitted,i,t} = 39\%$ | (53) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|

If CPDE is "Extreme accumulation rates", then *C%BSL-emitted,i,t =* 49% (54)

If there is no connectivity between the eroded area and a river-estuary system or the open sea and erosion mass is greater in the baseline scenario than the project scenario, then it is conservative to assume net zero emissions from eroded strata in the baseline scenario and the project scenario.

$$
C\%_{BSL-emitted,j,t} = 0\% \tag{55}
$$

If there is no connectivity between the eroded area and a river-estuary system or the open sea and erosion mass is the same or lower in the baseline scenario than the project scenario, then it is conservative to assume 100% emissions from eroded strata in the baseline scenario and the project scenario. The value in Equation 55 above is then 100%.

For both connected and non-connected systems, the project proponent may justify a greater *C%BSL-emitted,i,t* for the baseline scenario based on appropriate scientific research. In cases where erosion rates are lower in the project scenario than the baseline scenario and carbon fate is expected to be similar in both scenarios, this greater value of *C%BSL-emitted,i,t* must also be used for C%WPS-emitted,i,t.

Normal Marine CPDE with data showing very low sediment accumulation rates (less than 0.002 g cm-2 yr-1) may use a C%BSL-emitted,i,t value of 98.5%23.

###### 8.1.4.3.4 Modeling

A peer-reviewed published model may be used to generate a value of *GHGBSL-eroded-CO2,i,t , CBSLeroded,i,t , C%BSL-emitted,i,t , C%BSL-eroded,i,t , BD* or *Depth,* in the same or similar systems as those in the project area based on the guidelines in Section 8.1.4.1.

###### 8.1.4.3.5 Field-collected data

Soil coring may be used to generate a value of *CBSL-eroded,i,t , C%BSL-eroded,i,t , Depth* or *BD* as outlined in Section 9.3.7. For the baseline scenario, soil cores must be collected within 2 years prior to the project start date. Where the project proponent uses an installed reference plane for the baseline scenario, it must have been installed at least 4 years prior to the project start date, which is good practice to ensure that a reliable average accumulation rate is obtained.

*GHGBSL-eroded-CO2,i,t , CBSL-eroded,i,t , C%BSL-emiitted,i,t , C%BSL-eroded,i,t , BD* or *Depth* in the baseline scenario may be estimated using either historical data collected from the project area or chronosequence data collected at similar sites. Refer also to the instructions in Section 8.1.4.1.

<span id="page-43-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.4 CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Soil Exposed to an Aerobic Environment Through Excavation

For each stratum *i* at time *t* the project proponent must determine if piled-up soil<sup>24</sup> exposed to an aerobic environment exists within the project boundary.

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from soil exposed to an aerobic environment through excavation (*GHGBSL-excav-CO2,i,t*) may be calculated directly or may be calculated from estimates of the initial amount of carbon that is exposed (*CBSL-excav,i,t*) and the percentage of the exposed carbon that is returned to the atmosphere (*C%BSL-emitted,i,t*) as defined in Equation 56.

Estimates of *CBSL-excav,i,t* following the aerobic exposure event based on the extrapolation of *C%BSL-emitted,i,t* over the project crediting period must account for tendency of organic carbon concentrations to approach steady-state equilibrium in mineral soils. For this reason, a complete loss of soil organic carbon may not occur in mineral soils. This steady-state equilibrium must be determined conservatively.

Project proponents can use any combination of the following methods to calculate these terms:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Published values
- 3) Default factors
- 4) Models
- 5) Field-collected data, or

###### 8.1.4.4.1 Proxy-based approach

CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from excavated soil may be estimated using proxies (where such proxies meet the guidance in Section 8.1.4.1). Where the project proponent uses a proxy, such emissions are represented by the following equation:

```
GHGBSL-excav-CO2,i,t = ƒ (GHG emission proxy) (58)

###### 8.1.4.4.2 Published values

Peer-reviewed published data may be used to generate a value for *GHGBSL-excav-CO2,i,t*, *CBSL-excav,i,t, C%BSL-emitted,i,t,, C%BSL-excav,i,t, BD* and *Depth* based on the average rate of excavated soil CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in the same or similar systems as those in the project area, based on the guidelines in Section 8.1.4.1.

###### 8.1.4.4.4 Modeling

A peer-reviewed published model may be used to generate a value of *GHGBSL-excav-CO2,i,t , CBSLexcav,i,t , C%BSL-emitted,i,t,, C%BSL-excav,i,t , BD* or *Depth* in the same or similar systems as those in the project area based on the guidelines in Section 8.1.4.1.

Soil coring may be used to generate a value of *CBSL-excav,i,t , C%BSL-excav,i,t , BD* or *Depth* as outlined in Section 9.3.7. For the baseline scenario, soil cores must be collected within 2 years prior to the project start date.

<span id="page-45-0"></span>

##### 8.1.4.5 CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from soil

CH<sup>4</sup> emissions from soil in the baseline scenario may be conservatively excluded. If the project proponent can demonstrate that conditions for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in the baseline and project scenarios will not be different, or conditions will decline, these emissions need not be accounted for.

CH<sup>4</sup> emissions from soils may be estimated using:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Field-collected data
- 3) Published values
- 4) Default factors
- 5) Models, or
- 6) IPCC emission factors

Where the project proponent accounts for  $CH_4$  emissions in the baseline scenario, the options described in the sections below may be applied to estimate such emissions.

###### 8.1.4.5.1 Proxy-based approach

Where relevant, CH<sup>4</sup> emissions from organic soil may be estimated using proxies such as water table depth and vegetation composition (where such proxies meet the requirements in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above). Where the project proponent uses a proxy, such emissions are represented by the following equation:

<span id="page-46-0"></span>

###### 8.1.4.5.4 Default factor

For tidal wetland systems, a default factor*<sup>25</sup>* may be used in the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach for the estimation of *GHGBSL-soil-CH4,i,t*. Where the salinity average or salinity low point is >18 ppt, the project proponent may apply a default emission factor of:

$$
GHG_{BSL\text{-}soi-CH4,i,t} = 0.011 \text{ t} CH_4 \text{ ha}^{-1} \text{ yr}^{-1} \times CH_4\text{-}GWP

Where the salinity average or salinity low point is  $\geq$  20 ppt, the project proponent may apply a default emission factor of:

<span id="page-46-2"></span>
$$
GHG_{BSL\text{-}soil\text{-}CH4,i,t} = 0.0056 \text{ t} CH_4 \text{ ha}^{-1} \text{ yr}^{-1} \times CH_4\text{-}GWP
$$
 (61)

Procedures for measuring the salinity average or salinity low point are provided in Section [9.3.8.](#page-108-0)

The project proponent must not use the default value of 0.011 t CH<sub>4</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for the baseline scenario and 0.0056 t CH<sub>4</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for the project scenario to create a difference in emissions and claim an emission reduction. The use of the default factor is intended for projects that restore salinity levels from fresh/brackish to much higher levels that inhibit CH<sub>4</sub> emissions.

###### 8.1.4.5.5 Modeling

A quantitative model which meets the guidance in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above may also be used to estimate CH<sup>4</sup> emissions from the SOC pool.

###### 8.1.4.5.6 Emission factors

The most recently published IPCC emission factors may be used to estimate  $CH_4$  emissions from the SOC pool for non-tidal wetland systems. Tier 1 values may also be used, but must be applied conservatively including accounting for local salinity and vegetative cover conditions.

<span id="page-46-1"></span>

##### 8.1.4.6 N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soil

N2O emissions may be conservatively excluded in the baseline scenario. If the project proponent can demonstrate that conditions for  $N_2O$  emissions in the baseline and project

scenarios will not be different, or conditions will decline, these emissions need not be accounted for.

N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils may be estimated using:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Field-collected data
- 3) Published values
- 4) Default factors
- 5) Models, or
- 6) IPCC emission factors

Where the project proponent accounts for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the baseline scenario, the options described in the sections below may be applied to estimate such emissions.

###### 8.1.4.6.1 Proxy-based approach

Where relevant, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions may be estimated using proxies such as water table depth and vegetation composition (where such proxies meet the guidance in Section [8.1.4.1](#page-30-1) above). Where the project proponent uses a proxy, such emissions are represented by the following equation (note that the determination of the similarity of systems must include the nitrogen levels of the systems):

<span id="page-47-0"></span>
$$
GHG_{BSL\text{-}soil-N2O,i,t} = f (N_2O \text{ emission proxy}) \times N_2O\text{-}GWP

###### 8.1.4.6.2 Field-collected data

Field-collected data may be used to estimate  $N_2O$  emissions (see Section [9.3.8\)](#page-108-0).

###### 8.1.4.6.3 Published values

Peer-reviewed published data may be used to generate a value based on the average *N2O*  emissions rate in the same or similar systems as those in the project area based on the guidelines described in Section [8.1.4.1.](#page-30-1) Note that determination of the similarity of systems must include the nitrogen levels of the systems.

The following default factors*<sup>26</sup>* may be used for the estimation of *GHGBSL-soil-N2O,i,t* in the absence of data suitable for using the published value approach. Use of a default factor is only permitted for the systems listed below, except where the project area receives hydrologically direct inputs from a point or non-point source of nitrogen such as wastewater effluent or an intensively nitrogen-fertilized system.

For open water systems w*here the salinity average or salinity low point is >18 ppt:*

#### 8.1.5 Emissions from fossil fuel use in baseline scenario

Emissions from the use of vehicles and mechanical equipment in the baseline scenario (*GHGBSL-fuel,i,t*) may be conservatively excluded. However, these emissions in the baseline scenario may be estimated using the procedures in Section [8.2.6](#page-57-1) below.

<span id="page-49-0"></span>

### 8.2 Project Emissions

#### 8.2.1 General approach

Emissions in the project scenario are attributed to carbon stock changes in biomass carbon pools, soil processes, or a combination of these. In addition, where relevant, emissions from organic soil burns and fossil fuel use may be quantified.

Organic soil combustion due to anthropogenic fires is addressed using a conservative default factor (*Fire Reduction Premium*) that is expressed as a proportion of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions avoided through rewetting (see Section [8.3\)](#page-57-0).

Emissions in the project scenario are estimated as:

$$
GHG_{WPS} = GHG_{WPS-biomass} + GHG_{WPS-soil} + GHG_{WPS-burn} + GHG_{WPS-fuel}
$$
\n(69)

$$
GHG_{WPS-biomass} = -\sum_{t=1}^{t^*} \sum_{i=1}^{M_{WPS}} \left(\frac{44}{12} \times \Delta C_{WPS-biomass,i,t}\right)

*Ex-ante* estimates of *GHGWPS* must be based on a project scenario that is defined *ex ante*, and must be projected using the latest version of VCS module *VMD0019 Methods to Project Future Conditions*.

*Ex-post* estimates of *GHGWPS* must be based on monitoring results.

#### 8.2.2 Accounting for sea level rise

The *VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool* must be used to assess the future impacts of erosion and submergence due to sea level rise on the carbon stocks in the project. The tool provides procedures to determine contributions to the AFOLU pooled buffer account. Where a loss event occurs, projects must conform with the rules set out in the latest version of the *VCS Registration and Issuance Process*.

#### 8.2.3 Net carbon stock change in biomass carbon pools in project scenario

<span id="page-50-0"></span>Net carbon stock change in biomass carbon pools in the project scenario is estimated as:

 $\Delta$ *CWPS-biomass,i,t* =  $\Delta$ *CWPS-tree/shrub,i,t* +  $\Delta$ *CWPS-herb,i,t* (74)

#### Trees and shrubs

The net carbon stock change in trees and shrubs in the project scenario are estimated using CDM tool *AR-Tool14 Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities*, noting that the following equation applies:

<span id="page-51-0"></span>
$$
\Delta C_{WPS-tree/shrub,i,t} = 12/44 \times (\Delta C_{TREE\_PROJ,t} + \Delta C_{SHRUB\_PROJ,t})
$$
\n(75)

#### Where:

|                                | $       \(\Delta C_{BSL-tree/shrub,i,t}\) = Net carbon stock change in tree and shrub carbon pools in the project       scenario in stratum \(i\) in year t; t C yr-1 $                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $\(\Delta C_{TREE\_PROJ,t}\)$  | = Change in carbon stock in tree biomass in the project scenario in year $\(t\)$ ; t<br>CO2-e yr-1 (derived from application of AR- <i>Tool14</i> ; calculations are done for each<br>stratum $\(i\)$ )  |
| $\(\Delta C_{SHRUB\_PROJ,t}\)$ | = Change in carbon stock in shrub biomass in the project scenario in year $\(t\)$ ; t<br>CO2-e yr-1 (derived from application of AR- <i>Tool14</i> ; calculations are done for<br>each stratum $\(i\)$ ) |

For the ex-ante estimation of tree biomass, an IPCC default factor<sup>27</sup> may be used.

Where reforestation or revegetation activities in the project scenario include harvesting, the maximum number of GHG credits generated by these activities must not exceed the long-term average GHG benefit from the tree component.

For strata where harvesting occurs, the maximum carbon stock in tree biomass (C<sub>TREE,i,t</sub>) used in *AR-Tool14* is limited to *CAVG-TREE,i*, calculated as follows:

<span id="page-51-1"></span>
$$
C_{AVG-TREE,i} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} C_{TREE,i,t}}{n}
$$
\n
$$
(76)
$$

Where:

| $C_{AVG-TREE,i}$ | = Long-term average carbon stock in baseline or project tree biomass within the project<br>area (in stratum i) in time period n; t CO2-e                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $C_{TREE,i,t}$   | = Carbon stock in baseline or project tree biomass within the project area (in stratum i)<br>in year t (derived from application of AR-Tool14); t CO2-e yr-1 |

| t                | = 1, 2, 3 ... n years elapsed since the project start date                                                                                                   |

 $n =$  Total number of years in the established time period

The long-term average carbon stock must be calculated for both the baseline and the project scenario.

{52}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_52_Picture_1.jpeg)

For projects undertaking even-aged management, the time period *n* over which the long-term average GHG benefit is calculated includes at minimum one full harvest/cutting cycle, including the last harvest/cut in the cycle. For projects under conservation easements with no intention to harvest after the project crediting period (which must be shown in the project description based on verifiable information), or in case of selective cutting, the time period *n* over which the long-term average is calculated is the length of the project crediting period.

Projects may account for long-term carbon storage in wood products. In this case, the parameter *CTREE,t* in Equation 76 must be read as *CTREE,i,t + CWP,i,t*. Procedures for the calculation of *CWP,i,t* are provided in Appendix 1.

Examples of how to calculate the long-term average carbon benefit are provided in VCS document *AFOLU Guidance: Example for Calculating the Long-Term Average Carbon Stock for ARR Projects with Harvesting.*

Restoration projects which include afforestation or reforestation components may account for long-term carbon storage in wood products in case trees are harvested before dieback. In this case, the parameter *CTREE,t* in Equation 76 must be read as *CTREE,i,t + CWP,i,t.*

<span id="page-52-1"></span>*CAVG-SHRUB,i* is calculated as follows:

$$
C_{AVG-SHRUB,i} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} C_{SHRUB,i,t}}{n} \tag{77}

| $n$          | = Total number of years in the established time period                             |

#### Herbaceous vegetation

The net carbon stock change in herbaceous vegetation biomass in the project scenario is estimated using a carbon stock change approach as follows:

<span id="page-52-0"></span>*ΔCWPS-herb,i,t* = (*CWPS-herb,i,t* – *CWPS-herb,i,,(t-T)*) / *T* (78)

Where:

| $\Delta C_{WPS-herb,i,t}$ | = Net carbon stock changes in herb carbon pools in the project scenario in<br>stratum i in year t; t C yr-1 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $C_{WPS-herb,i,t}$        | = Carbon stock in herbaceous vegetation in the project scenario in stratum i in                             |

{53}------------------------------------------------

| year $t$ | t C ha-1 |
|----------|----------|
|----------|----------|

- t  $= 1, 2, 3 ...$  t\* years elapsed since the start of the project activity
- T  $=$  Time elapsed between two successive estimations ( $T=t_2-t_1$ )

A default factor for *CWPS*-*herb*,*i*,*<sup>t</sup>* of 3 t C ha-1 (see Section [8.1.3\)](#page-28-0) may be applied for strata with 100% herbaceous cover. For areas with a vegetation cover <100%, a 1:1 relationship between vegetation cover and *CWPS*-*herb*,*i*,*<sup>t</sup>* must be applied. The default factor may be claimed only for the first year of the project crediting period as herbaceous biomass quickly reaches a steady state. Vegetation cover must be determined by commonly used techniques in field biology. Procedures for measuring carbons stocks in herbaceous vegetation are provided in Section [9.3.6.](#page-107-0) The above default factor may not be applied in case *AR-Tool14* is used.

Where the carbon stock change in herbaceous vegetation is quantified in the project scenario, it must also be quantified in the baseline scenario.

#### 8.2.4 Net GHG emissions and removals from soil in project scenario

| GHGWPS-eroded-CO2,i,t | = CO2 emissions from the eroded SOC pool in the project scenario in stratum i in year t ; t CO2e ha-1 yr-1                                                      |
| GHGWPS-excav-CO2,i,t  | = CO2 emissions from the SOC pool of soil exposed to an aerobic environment through excavation in the project scenario in stratum i in year t; t CO2e ha-1 yr-1 |

 $CO<sub>2</sub>$  emissions from soils may be estimated using one of the following approaches:

- 1) Proxies
- 2) Published values
- 3) Default factors
- 4) Models, or
- 5) Field-collected data

In certain cases, allochthonous soil organic carbon may accumulate in the project area, and such carbon must be accounted for in the project scenario. Procedures for the estimation of a compensation factor for allochthonous soil organic carbon are specified in Sections [8.1.4.2.7](#page-37-0) and [8.2.4.2.2.](#page-55-0)

###### 8.2.4.2.1 Approaches for estimating *GHGWPS-insitu-CO2,i,t GHGWPS-eroded-CO2,i,t* and *GHGWPS-*

###### *excav-CO2,i,t*

*GHGWPS-insitu-CO2,i,t* , *GHGWPS-eroded-CO2,i,t* and *GHGWPS-excav-CO2,i,t* must be calculated using the same procedures in Section [8.1.4](#page-30-0) above. For all equations in these sections*,* the subscript *BSL* must be substituted by *WPS* to make clear that the relevant values are being quantified for the project scenario. For these parameters, descriptions are provided in Section Error! Reference source not found.. If it can be demonstrated that *GHGWPS-eroded-CO2,i,t* is the result of sea level rise, projects do not need to account for this emission source, as it is included in the *VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool*.

For both connected and non-connected systems, the project proponent may justify a lower C%WPS-emitted,i,t for the project scenario based on appropriate scientific research. In cases where erosion rates are lower in the project scenario than the baseline scenario and carbon

{55}------------------------------------------------

fate is expected to be similar in both scenarios, this lower value of C%WPS-emitted,i,t must also be used for C%BSL-emitted,i,t.

<span id="page-55-0"></span>

##### 8.2.4.2.2 Deduction for allochthonous carbon

A deduction must be applied to account for allochthonous carbon using the procedures in Section [8.1.4.2.7.](#page-37-0) The project proponent must also follow the additional guidance below.

The determination of the deduction for allochthonous carbon is mandatory for the project scenario unless the project proponent is able to demonstrate that the allochthonous carbon would have been returned to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide in the absence of the project.

The deduction for allochthonous carbon must only be applied to soil layers deposited or accumulated after the project start date (such as materials formed above a feldspar marker horizon).

If the organic surface layer exceeds 10 cm, the soil is deemed organic and no deduction is required. If an organic surface layer of up to 10 cm is present, *deduction\_alloch* must be determined only in such cases where the project experiences mineral sedimentation events sufficient to create mineral soil layers. In practice, the project area may show mineral sedimentation in places. If this is observed it is assumed that at some point during the project crediting period mineral sediment can be deposited on top of organic surface layers, unless the project proponent can justify that strata with an organic surface layer of less than 10 cm will not experience mineral sedimentation during the project crediting period.

##### 8.2.4.3 CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from soil

Where the project proponent is able to demonstrate (e.g., if salinity values will not change or will increase) that CH<sup>4</sup> emissions do not increase in the project scenario compared to the baseline scenario, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions may be excluded.

The estimation of  $CH_4$  emissions in project scenario must follow one of the approaches provided in Section [8.1.4.5](#page-45-0) above*.* For all equations in these sections*,* the subscript *BSL* must be substituted by *WPS* to make clear that the relevant values are being quantified for the project scenario.

##### 8.2.4.4 N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soil

Where the project proponent is able to demonstrate (e.g., by referring to peer-reviewed literature based on similar project circumstances<sup>29</sup>) that  $N_2O$  emissions do not increase in the project scenario compared to the baseline scenario,  $N_2O$  emissions may be excluded.

 $29$  Project circumstances are defined by pre-project land use (eg, forestry, agriculture, abandonment after such activities) and its intensity (especially related to N-fertilization), climatic zone, water table depths, and soil type.

{56}------------------------------------------------

N<sub>2</sub>O emissions must be accounted for in the project scenario in strata where water levels were lowered as a result of project activities<sup>30</sup>. Seagrass restoration projects do not require  $N_2O$ emission accounting. The estimation of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the project scenario may follow one of the approaches provided in Section [8.1.4.6.](#page-46-1) For all equations in these sections*,* the subscript *BSL* must be substituted by *WPS* to make clear that the relevant values are being quantified for the project scenario.

In addition, where the project proponent is able to demonstrate (e.g., by referring to peerreviewed literature) that N2O emissions in the project scenario are *de minimis*, N2O emissions may be excluded. To demonstrate that N2O emissions are *de minimis* in the project scenario, the project proponent must use CDM tool *AR-Tool04 Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities*, or refer to peer-reviewed literature.

#### 8.2.5 Net non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from prescribed burning in project scenario

Where the project proponent introduces prescribed burning of shrub and herbaceous biomass, the project proponent must a) demonstrate that the project does not decrease carbon sequestration rates if using the default factor approach for carbon dioxide emissions accounting from soil, and b) account for  $CH_4$  and  $N_2O$  emissions as follows:

### <span id="page-57-0"></span>8.3 Emission reductions due to rewetting and fire management (Fire Reduction Premium)

This methodology addresses the emission reductions generated from reduced anthropogenic fires occurring in drained organic soils due to rewetting and fire management. Emission reductions are estimated using a conservative default factor which is based on fire occurrence and extension in the project area in the baseline scenario. This method avoids the need for direct assessment of GHG emissions from fire in the baseline and the project scenarios. The project proponent must apply the latest version of VCS module *VMD0046 Methods for monitoring soil carbon stock changes and GHG emissions in WRC project activities* to estimate of the *Fire Reduction Premium* (*FRP*).

#### 8.4 Leakage

#### Activity-shifting leakage and market leakage 8.4.1

The applicability conditions of this methodology are structured to ensure that activity-shifting leakage and market leakage do not occur. As such, where the applicability conditions of this methodology are met, activity-shifting leakage and market leakage may be assumed to be zero.

#### 8.4.2 Ecological leakage

It may be assumed that ecological leakage does not occur in projects meeting the applicability conditions of this methodology, because projects must be designed in a manner which ensures that their hydrological connectivity with adjacent areas does not lead to a significant increase in GHG emissions outside the project area. This may be achieved by a project design which causes no alteration of mean annual water table depths or flooding frequency or duration in adjacent areas, or limiting such alteration to levels that do not influence GHG emissions. Where, at the design stage, hydrological changes are expected to impact GHG emissions in areas outside the project area, the project design must be adjusted to include such areas in the project area.

The project proponent must demonstrate that their project design meets these requirements through expert judgment, hydrologic modeling or monitoring of alterations of water table depth at the project area. In tidal wetland restoration projects, de-watering downstream wetlands is not expected if project areas are set sufficiently large to include expected areas of changed hydrology.

Hydrologic models must consider water displacement from project activities and the hydrologic connection or blockage of inlets that would change the wetland boundary. Procedures for monitoring alterations of water table depth at the project area are provided in Section [9.3.4.](#page-105-1)

The tidal range and sediment delivery experienced by wetlands outside the project area must remain within the system tolerance, which is defined by the high and low tides and regional sediment budget, and assessed using hydrological models (and/or empirical analysis) and expert judgment.

To guide this assessment, Table 3 outlines avoidance criteria related to a variety of processes that may occur outside the project area due to an inappropriate project design.

For projects claiming reductions of baseline GHG emissions, or for conservation and restoration projects where sea level rise may cause a loss of tidal wetland and associated biomass and/or soil organic carbon stocks, the maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions or removals that may be claimed from the biomass and soil organic carbon pool is limited to the net GHG benefit generated by the project 100 years after its start date, as follows:

#### *NERRWE-max* = *NERRWE* at *t* = 100 (86)

| $NER_{RWE}$     | = Net CO2e emission reductions from the RWE project activity (from Equation<br>85); t CO2e                                                                          |

Note also that *NERRWE* must be corrected for uncertainty by estimating the total uncertainty for the RWE project activity (*NERRWE\_ERROR*) using the procedures in Section [8.5.2](#page-60-0) below.

<span id="page-60-0"></span>

#### 8.5.2 Estimation of uncertainty

The following procedure allows the project proponent to estimate uncertainty in the estimation of emissions and carbon stock changes (i.e., for calculating a precision level and any deduction in credits for lack of precision following project implementation and monitoring) by assessing uncertainty in baseline and project estimations.

This procedure focuses on the following sources of uncertainty:

- Uncertainty associated with estimation of stocks in carbon pools and changes in carbon stocks
- Uncertainty in assessment of project emissions

Where an uncertainty value is not known or cannot be calculated, the project proponent must justify that it is using a conservative number and an uncertainty of 0% may be used for this component.

#### Uncertainty guidance

A precision target of a 90% or 95% confidence interval equal to or less than 20% or 30%, respectively, of the recorded value must be targeted. This is especially important in terms of project planning for measurement of carbon stocks where sufficient measurement plots should be included to achieve this precision level across the measured stocks.

Levels of uncertainty must be known for all aspects of baseline and project implementation and monitoring. Uncertainty will generally be known as the 90% or 95% confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the mean. Where uncertainty is not known, it must be demonstrated that the value used is conservative.

{61}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_61_Picture_1.jpeg)

Estimated carbon emissions and removals arising from AFOLU activities have uncertainties associated with the measures and estimates of several parameters. These include the project area or other activity data, carbon stocks, biomass growth rates, expansion factors and other coefficients. It is assumed that the uncertainties associated with the estimates of the various input data are available, either as default factors given in IPCC Guidelines (2006), IPCC GPG-LULUCF (2003), expert judgment or estimates based of sound statistical sampling.

Alternatively, conservative estimates may also be used instead of uncertainties, provided that they are based on verifiable literature sources or expert judgment. In this case the uncertainty is assumed to be zero. However, these procedures combine uncertainty information and conservative estimates resulting in an overall *ex-post* project uncertainty.

#### Planning to diminish uncertainty

It is important that the process of project planning consider uncertainty. Procedures including stratification and the allocation of sufficient measurement plots help ensure that low uncertainty in carbon stocks results and ultimately full crediting can result.

It is good practice to apply this procedure at an early stage to identify the data sources with the highest uncertainty to allow the opportunity to conduct further work to diminish uncertainty.

Note that in Parts  $1 - 3$  below the denominators of the equations must be expressed in absolute values.

#### 8.5.3 Calculation of Verified Carbon Units

In order to calculate the number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) that may be issued, the project proponent must consider the number of buffer credits which must be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account. The number of buffer credits which must be deposited in the AFOLU pooled buffer account is based on the net change in carbon stocks.

The number of verified carbon units (VCUs) is calculated as:

$$
VCU_{t2} = (adjusted_{NER_{t2}} - adjusted_{NER_{t1}}) \times Bufferw_{t2}

| Justification of choice of<br>data or description of<br>measurement methods<br>and procedures applied | Extrapolation of $Rate_{Closs-BSL,i}$ over the entire project crediting<br>period for the quantification of the SDT must account for the<br>possibility of a non-linear decrease of soil organic carbon over<br>time, including the tendency of organic carbon concentrations to<br>approach steady-state equilibrium (see Section Error! Reference<br>source not found.). For this reason, a complete loss of soil<br>organic carbon may not occur in mineral soils. This steady-state<br>equilibrium must be determined conservatively. |

| Justification of choice of data or description of measurement methods and procedures applied | This value is conservatively set to zero as loss rates are likely be negative. The value must be reassessed when the baseline reassessed. If at that event there is evidence that SOC has decreased, the calculation must be adjusted using the carbon loss rate to date, unless it can be justified that the carbon loss was temporary. |

| Justification of choice of<br>data or description of<br>measurement methods<br>and procedures applied | A default factor32 of 3 t C ha-1 may be applied for strata with<br>100% herbaceous cover. For areas with a vegetation cover<br><100%, a 1:1 relationship between vegetation cover and $C_{BSL,herb,i,t}$ must be applied. The default may be claimed for one year<br>only during the project crediting period as herbaceous biomass<br>quickly reaches a steady state.<br>Vegetation cover must be determined by commonly used<br>techniques in field biology.<br>Procedures for measuring carbons stocks in herbaceous<br>vegetation are provided in Section 9.3.6 above. |

Data / Parameter *C%BSL-emitted,i,t*

C%BSL-emitted,i,t

<sup>32</sup> Calculated from peak aboveground biomass data from 20 sites summarized in Mitsch & Gosselink. The median of these studies is 1.3 t d.m. ha-1 . This was converted to the default factor value as follows: 1.3 × 0.45 × 0.5 × 10. The factor 0.45 converts organic matter mass to carbon mass; the factor 0.5 is a factor that averages annual peak biomass (factor = 1) and annual minimum biomass (factor = 0, assuming ephemeral aboveground biomass and complete litter decomposition.

| Justification of choice of<br>data or description of<br>measurement methods<br>and procedures applied | This volume does not include logging slash left onsite. The<br>project proponent should also make sure that extracted volumes<br>are gross volumes removed (i.e., not already discounting for<br>estimated wood waste). Assignment of volume extracted to wood<br>product class(es), must be substantiated on the basis of<br>participatory rural appraisal (PRA) findings or records of timber<br>sales. Assignment of volume extracted to species, must be<br>substantiated on the basis of either PRA findings, harvest<br>records, or a commercial inventory. |

## 9.3 Description of the Monitoring Plan

### 9.3.1 General

The main objective of project monitoring is to reliably quantify carbon stocks and GHG emissions in the project scenario during the project crediting period, prior to each verification, with the following main tasks:

- Monitor project carbon stock changes and GHG emissions
- Estimate *ex-post* net carbon stock changes and GHG emissions, and GHG emission reductions

The monitoring plan must contain at least the following information:

- A description of each monitoring task to be undertaken, and the technical requirements therein
- Parameters to be measured
- Data to be collected and data collection techniques
- Frequency of monitoring
- Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures
- Data archiving procedures
- Roles, responsibilities and capacity of monitoring team and management

<span id="page-103-1"></span>

### 9.3.2 Uncertainty and quality management

Quality management procedures are required for the management of data and information, including the assessment of uncertainty relevant to the project and baseline scenarios. As far as practical, uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals by sinks should be reduced.

{104}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_104_Picture_1.jpeg)

To help reduce uncertainties in the accounting of emissions and removals, this methodology uses whenever possible the methods from the GPG-LULUCF, GPG-2000, the IPCC's Revised 2006 Guidelines and peer-reviewed literature. Despite this, potential uncertainties still arise from the choice of parameters to be used. Uncertainties arising from input parameters would result in uncertainties in the estimation of both baseline net GHG emissions and project net GHG emissions, especially when global default factors are used. The project proponent must identify key parameters that would significantly influence the accuracy of estimates. Local values that are specific to the project circumstances must then be obtained for these key parameters, whenever possible. These values should be based on:

- Data from well-referenced peer-reviewed literature or other well-established published sources<sup>35</sup>:
- National inventory data or default data from IPCC literature that has, whenever possible and necessary, been checked for consistency against available local data specific to the project circumstances; or
- In the absence of the above sources of information, expert opinion may be used to assist with data selection. Experts will often provide a range of data, as well as a most probable value for the data. The rationale for selecting a particular data value must be described in the project description.

In choosing key parameters, or making important assumptions based on information that is not specific to the project circumstances, such as in use of default data, the project proponent must select values that will lead to an accurate estimation of net GHG emission reductions, taking into account uncertainties.

If uncertainty is significant, the project proponent must choose data such that it indisputably tends to under-estimate, rather than over-estimate, net GHG project benefits.

To ensure that carbon stocks are estimated in a way that is accurate, verifiable, transparent, and consistent across measurement periods, the project proponent must establish and document clear standard operating procedures and procedures for ensuring data quality. At a minimum, these procedures must include:

- Comprehensive documentation of all field measurements carried out in the project area. This document must be detailed enough to allow replication of sampling in the event of staff turnover between monitoring periods.
- Training procedures for all persons involved in field measurement or data analysis. The scope and date of all training must be documented.
- A protocol for assessing the accuracy of plot measurements using a check cruise and a plan for correcting the inventory if errors are discovered.
- Protocols for assessing data for outliers, transcription errors, and consistency across

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>35</sup> Typically, citations for sources of data used should include: the report or paper title, publisher, page numbers, publication date, etc. (or a detailed web address). If web-based reports are cited, hardcopies should be included as annexes in the project description if there is any likelihood that such reports may not be permanently available.

{105}------------------------------------------------

measurement periods.

• Data sheets must be safely archived for the life of the project. Data stored in electronic formats must be backed up.

<span id="page-105-0"></span>

### 9.3.3 Expert judgment

The use of expert judgment for the selection and interpretation of methods, selection of input data to fill gaps in available data, and selection of data from a range of possible values or uncertainty ranges, is well established in the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance. Obtaining well-informed judgments from domain experts regarding best estimates and uncertainties is an important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The project proponent must use the guidance provided in Chapter 2 (Approaches to Data Collection), in particular, Section 2.2 and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance.

<span id="page-105-1"></span>

### 9.3.4 Monitoring of project implementation

Information must be provided and recorded in the project description to establish that:

- 1) The geographic position of the project area is recorded for all areas of wetland. The geographic coordinates of the project area (and any stratification or buffer zones inside the area are established, recorded and archived. This can be achieved by field survey (e.g., using GPS), or by using georeferenced spatial data (e.g., maps, GIS datasets, orthorectified aerial photography or georeferenced remote sensing images). The above also applies to the recording of strata.
- 2) Commonly accepted principles of land use inventory and management are implemented.
  - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control/quality assurance (QA/QC) procedures for inventories including field data collection and data management must be applied. Use or adaptation of SOPs already applied in national land use monitoring, or available from published handbooks, or from the IPCC GPG LULUCF 2003, is recommended.
  - Apply SOPs, especially, for actions likely to cause soil disturbances.
  - Project planning documentation, together with a record of the plan as actually implemented during the project must be available for validation or verification, as appropriate.

Continued compliance with the applicability conditions of this methodology must be ensured by monitoring that:

- The water table is not lowered except where the project converts open water to tidal wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters.
- The burning of organic soil as a project activity does not occur.
- Peatland fires within the project area do not occur in the project scenario. If they do occur as non-catastrophic events, they are accounted for by cancelling the Fire Reduction Premium for the entire project or the individual project activity instance.

{106}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_106_Picture_1.jpeg)

• N-fertilizers are not used within the project area in the project scenario.

Where the project proponent chooses to monitor alterations of water table depth in the project area to demonstrate no alteration of mean annual water table depths in adjacent areas, or that such alteration is limited to levels that do not influence GHG emissions, the project proponent must use water level gauges or vegetation assessments, or a combination of these. Water level gauges must be installed in the project area and readings must be compared with the hydrological modeling results or expert judgment on which the establishment of the project area was based. The number and spacing of water level gauges must be based on hydrological modeling or expert judgment.

### 9.3.5 Stratification and sampling framework

Stratification of the project area into relatively homogeneous units may either increase the measuring precision without increasing the cost unduly, or reduce the cost without reducing measuring precision because of the lower variance within each homogeneous unit. The project proponent must present in the project description an *ex-ante* stratification of the project area or justify the lack of it. The number and boundaries of the strata defined *ex ante* may change during the project crediting period (*ex post*).

The *ex-post* stratification must be updated where the following occur:

- Unexpected disturbances occurring during the project crediting period (e.g., due to changes in the hydrology, fire, pests or disease outbreaks), affecting differently various parts of an originally homogeneous stratum;
- Management activities (forestry, agriculture, hydrology) that are implemented in a way that affects the existing stratification.

Established strata may be merged if the reasons for their establishment are no longer relevant.

The sampling framework, including sample size, plot size, plot shape, and determination of plot location must be specified in the project description. Where changes in carbon stocks are to be monitored (e.g., in trees), permanent sampling plots must be used, noting the following:

- 1) To determine the sample size and allocation among strata, the latest version of the CDM tool *AR-Tool03 Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A/R CDM project activities* may be used. The targeted confidence interval must be 90% or 95%. Where a 90% confidence interval is adopted and the width of the confidence interval exceeds 20% of the estimated value or where a 95% confidence interval is adopted and the width of the confidence interval exceeds 30% of the estimated value, an appropriate confidence deduction must be applied, as specified in Section [8.5.2.](#page-60-0)
- 2) In order to avoid bias, sample plots should be marked inconspicuously.
- 3) The sample plot size must be established according to common practice in forest, vegetation and soil inventories.

4) To avoid subjective choice of plot locations, the permanent sample plots must be located either systematically with a random start or completely randomly inside each defined stratum. The geographical position (GPS coordinate), administrative location, stratum and stand, series number of each plot, as well as the procedure used for locating them must be recorded and archived. The sampling plots are to be as evenly distributed as possible, where larger strata have more plots than smaller strata. However, remote areas and areas with poor accessibility may be excluded for the location of sampling plots. Such areas must be mapped as separate strata and for these strata accounting of carbon stocks in tree biomass in the project scenario is conservatively omitted (see Section [5.2.2\)](#page-14-0).

The choice of monitoring frequency must be justified in the project description.

### 9.3.6 Sampling of herbaceous vegetation

Aboveground herbaceous mass (herb) is defined as a pool that includes both living plant mass (i.e., biomass) and dead plant mass (i.e., litter). All living and dead herbaceous mass is clipped above the soil surface from inside each sample frame. Dry mass is determined by either drying the entire wet sample to a constant weight, or drying a subsample of the wet mass to determine a dry-to-wet mass ratio conversion factor. Because aboveground mass can be highly seasonal, the average pool must be calculated from at least two samples representing the minimum and maximum standing stocks. Alternatively, a conservative estimate of the pool may be determined from a sample taken at the time of minimum standing stock.

### 9.3.7 Soil coring approach for estimating soil carbon

Soil organic carbon (*CWPS-soil,i,t*) may be estimated by determining the organic carbon accumulated above a consistent reference plane. The reference plane must be established using a marker horizon (most commonly using feldspar)*36*, a strongly contrasting soil layer (such as the boundary between organic and mineral soil materials), an installed reference plane (such as the shallow marker in a surface elevation table)*37*, a layer identified biogeochemically (such as through radionuclide, heavy metal, or biological tracers)*38*, a layer with soil organic carbon indistinguishable from the baseline SOC concentration (as determined in Section [8.1.4.2\)](#page-32-0) *<sup>39</sup>* or other accepted technologies. Note that feldspar marker horizons should not be used in systems where they are unstable, such as some sandy soils and systems with significant bioturbation. The material below the reference plane may be conservatively assumed to have zero change due to project activities.

The material located above the reference plane must be analyzed for total carbon and bulk density. Sediment samples may be collected for the estimation of  $\%C_{\text{denseed}}$  (see Section

Total organic carbon must be analyzed directly using CHN elemental analysis or the Walkley-Black chromic acid wet oxidation method or determined from loss-onignition (LOI) data using the following equation:

|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| %C = 0.415 × %OM + 2.8857 (only for mangrove soils) 42            | (96) |

<span id="page-108-1"></span>%C = -0.33 + 0.43 (%OM) (only for seagrass soils with %OM > 20%) *<sup>44</sup>* (98)

Alternatively, an equation developed using site-specific data may be used or an equation from peer-reviewed literature may be used if the equation represents soils from the same or similar systems as those in the project area.

Inorganic carbon should be removed from samples if present in significant quantities, usually through acid treatment (such as sulfurous or hydrochloric acid). Live coarse below-ground tree biomass should be removed from soil samples prior to analysis. Additional live below-ground biomass may be removed or included. Soil samples collected may be aggregated to reduce the variability.

### 9.3.8 Monitoring $CH_4$ and $N_2O$ emissions

Direct measurement of  $CH_4$  and/or  $N_2O$  emissions may be made with either a closed chamber technique or a chamber-less technique such as eddy covariance flux. For eddy covariance

methods, the guidelines presented in VCS methodology VM0024 Methodology for Coastal Wetland Creation must be followed, taking into account the additional guidance below.

Flux measurements are expected to conform to standard best practices used in the scientific community45. The basic design of the closed chamber for wetlands requires a base that extends into the soil (5 cm minimum), and a chamber that is placed over the plants and sealed to the base. To prevent the measurement from disturbing  $CH_4$  emissions, the base should be placed at least one day in advance, and the plot should be approached on an elevated ramp or boardwalk when taking samples, although failure to do so is conservative because it will cause higher fluxes. CH<sub>4</sub> flux is calculated as the difference in initial and final headspace CH<sub>4</sub> concentration, without removing non-linear increases caused by bubble (ebullition) fluxes that may have occurred. Initial and final concentrations will be determined as the average of duplicate determinations. Because  $CH_4$  and  $N_2O$  emissions can be low from tidal wetlands, it may be necessary to enclose large areas ( $\geq$  0.25 m<sup>2</sup>) or lengthen the measurement period to improve sensitivity.

Methane emissions from strata lacking vegetation (<25% cover), such as open water, hollows or ponds, can be dominated by episodic bubble emissions (i.e., ebullition). Chambers for open water emissions are typically a single piece that floats such that the bottom extends under the water surface (5 cm minimum). Floating chambers must be deployed for a minimum of 4 days.

Eddy covariance techniques sense total  $CH_4$  and  $N_2O$  emissions (diffusive and ebullition) at high temporal resolution; such systems must be deployed for a minimum of 48 hours of useable data.

 $CH<sub>4</sub>$  and  $N<sub>2</sub>O$  emission estimates must be either accurate or conservative. Accurate estimates must account for variation in time caused by changes in plant activity, temperature, water table depth, salinity and other sources of variation, and in space caused by factors such as topography (e.g., hummocks versus hollows) or plant cover. A conservative estimate may be based on direct measurements taken at times and places in which  $CH_4$  or  $N_2O$  emissions are expected to be the highest based on expert judgment, datasets or literature.

Fluxes must be measured in the stratum with the highest emissions. For CH4, these are likely to be strata in the wettest strata that support emergent vegetation, but may include stagnant pools of water. Eddy flux towers must be placed so that the footprint lies in the stratum with the highest  $CH_4$  or  $N_2O$  emissions for 50% of the time.  $CH_4$  fluxes must be measured when the water table is <10 cm from the soil surface, during times of year when emissions are highest, such as the warmest month and/or wettest month. When CH<sup>4</sup> emission rates incorporate measurements from periods of time outside the peak, they must be made at approximately monthly intervals.

In addition to the conservative principles above, the project proponent must consider other factors that are specific to the method applied. In particular, closed chambers must be

transparent and deployed in daylight unless it is can be shown that CH<sup>4</sup> emissions are not sensitive to light.

Regardless of method, emissions must be averaged and expressed as daily (24 hour) rates and converted to annual estimates using the following equations:

Where the default factor approach is used for CH<sup>4</sup> emissions (see Section [8.1.4.5.4\)](#page-46-0)*,* the salinity average or salinity low point will be measured on shallow pore water (within 30 cm from soil surface) using a handheld salinity refractometer or other accepted technology. The salinity average must be calculated from observations that represent variation in salinity during periods of peak CH<sup>4</sup> emissions (e.g., during the growing season in temperate ecosystems or the wet season in tropical ecosystems). When the number of observations during this period is small (fewer than one per month for one year), the salinity low point from these data must be used. The salinity of the floodwater source (e.g., an adjacent tidal creek) during this period may be used as a proxy for salinity in pore water provided there is regular hydrologic exchange between the source and the wetland (i.e., the source floods the wetland at least on 20% of high tides).

{111}------------------------------------------------

### 9.3.9 Monitoring of soil subsidence

Where soil subsidence on drained wetlands is used as a proxy for carbon loss and  $CO<sub>2</sub>$ emissions, applied techniques and calculations must follow international standards of application or local standards as laid out in pertinent scientific literature or handbooks. The lowering of the organic soil surface over time (subsidence) must be measured relative to a fixed point (datum) (e.g., using a pole fixed in the mineral subsoil). Dipwells used for water table depth monitoring may be used for subsidence monitoring with the advantage that water table depth and subsidence are monitored at the exact same location. In areas where fire may occur, it is best (also) to place iron poles. If poles are lost due to fire, new poles must be installed. Height losses due to fire must be treated separately from those caused by microbial oxidation of the organic soil in assessing carbon losses.

Interpolation of the trend in organic soil height loss over a longer period surrounding the fire event allows for quantifying height loss due to the fire. At least 10 replicate subsidence poles must be evenly distributed per stratum. To prevent disturbance, poles may need to be fenced in. In order to avoid disturbance of the organic soil surface during readings it is advisable to place boardwalks. For remote and inaccessible areas, the project proponent may rely on vegetation cover as an indicator for water table depth and associated subsidence rates as supported by data or literature references in a conservative way. The minimum monitoring frequency for soil subsidence is once a year.

Consolidation of the saturated organic soil below the water table may contribute to subsidence over multiple years. The project proponent must conservatively assess the contribution of consolidation to overall subsidence by reference to literature values or expert judgment or demonstrate that consolidation plays an insignificant role in overall subsidence (< 5%).

The calculation of carbon loss rates from subsidence data must follow pertinent scientific literature (e.g., Couwenberg & Hooijer 2013) and usually requires data on the volumetric carbon content of the organic soil. When subsidence measurements are used to establish emission factors to be associated with other proxies, measurements must be carried out over a period of at least 24 months to cover intra- and inter-annual variability.

### 9.3.10 Estimation of Eroded Soil Depth and Depth of Soil Exposed to Aerobic Conditions

Soil carbon loss may occur through three mechanisms: 1) vertical edge erosion at a wetland edge or channel bank, generally occurring at the seaward margin of wetlands exposed to wave energy, 2) horizontal surface soil erosion; and/or 3) soil exposure to aerobic conditions.

1. Vertical edge erosion at a wetland edge or channel bank: The depth of eroded soil may be measured in the field directly from the difference in elevation between the emergent wetland surface at the wetland edge to the surface of an adjacent mudflat, or sediments below adjacent waters. The adjacent point must be chosen conservatively, and must represent the shallowest point of the transition from the wetland to mudflat

{112}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_112_Picture_1.jpeg)

or adjacent subaquatic sediment surface. Determination of the surface elevation of mudflat slope must be based upon the projected amount of emergent wetland retreat. Internal loss of sediment through channel enlargement and or channel network expansion occurs in wetlands with insufficient sediment supply to build at a pace matching sea level rise in settings with a tidal range greater than 1 m. Change in channel volume can be calculated using hydraulic geometry equations and approaches.<sup>46</sup>

- 2. Horizontal surface soil erosion: Soil depth may be calculated by direct measurement at a reference site with reference to a datum that can be justified as not having shifted vertically relative to the original soil surface. This datum may be depth to a mineral soil horizon that has not shifted due to compaction or a bedrock soil horizon, a point on mangrove stumps held in place vertically (generally due to soils composed of coarse silt or sand), or through radiometric analysis to identify the age of exposed soil surfaces.
- 3. Soil exposure to aerobic conditions: The depth of soil exposed to aerobic conditions through drainage is intended to identify the depth at which anaerobic conditions no longer suppress organic matter decomposition as they do in wetland soils. In wetland science, these anaerobic conditions are generally understood to correspond to the conditions in which iron is reduced. The depth to which the soil is reducing with respect to iron may be identified using platinum electrodes, IRIS (Indicator of Reduction in Soils) Tubes, <sup>47</sup> the presence of reduced iron in pore water or on soil ped surfaces (indicated with Alpha-alpha-Dipyridyl or other laboratory analysis), or other accepted technologies. These methods must be used during the time of year with the peak height of anaerobic conditions (i.e., peak sustained water table and sufficient temperature for microbial activity48).

<span id="page-112-0"></span>

### 9.3.11 Monitoring Water Table

If water table is used as a proxy for carbon loss and GHG emissions, monitoring of water tables in the project or proxy area must be based on measurements in appropriate strata. Water table depth measurements can be continuous with data loggers and using min-max devices or simple water level gauges (dip wells consisting of e.g., perforated PVC tubes), Applied techniques must follow international standards of application or local standards as laid out in pertinent scientific literature or handbooks.

Water table depth measurements must be carried out at least every two months. At least 10 replicate dip wells must be evenly distributed per stratum, to ensure data consistency also

<sup>46</sup> e.g., Allen 2000; Williams and Orr 2002

<sup>47</sup> Rabenhorst *et.al*. 2013

<sup>48</sup> Vaughan *et.al*. 2009

{113}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_113_Picture_1.jpeg)

when dip wells are lost. In peat swamp forest, dip wells must be placed in surface depressions between tree mounds. Visual inspection of the multiple records within a single stratum allows for identification of outlier values at single locations, indicating measurement errors that should be excluded from analysis. For remote and inaccessible areas, project proponents may rely on vegetation cover as an indicator for water table depth as supported by data or literature references in a conservative way.

# APPENDIX 1: LONG-TERM CARBON STORAGE IN WOOD PRODUCTS

### Introduction

The procedures included in this appendix allow for the *ex-ante* estimation of carbon stocks in the long-term wood products pool in the project scenario. The procedures are applicable to all cases where wood is harvested for conversion to wood products for commercial markets, for all forest types and age classes.

The approach outlined employs an emission factor (*WW*) derived by Winjum *et al.* 1998. In the event that new research findings updating or refining (e.g., for specific countries) the WW factor become available in the future (during the project crediting period), they must be used in place of the factors included in this appendix; otherwise the factors will remain valid. The use of this appendix requires that project proponents review research findings (that produce emissions factors compatible with the conceptual framework here) at least every 10 years to identify further refinements to the emission factors that are empirically based and peer reviewed.

All factors are derived from Winjum *et al*. 1998.

If approved timber harvest plans, specifying harvest intensity per strata in terms of volume extracted per ha, are available for the project area, use Option 1. If approved harvest plans are not available, use Option 2.

Once actual extraction data is obtained from the project site, they must be monitored and used for calculations. At each verification event, the long-term average must be recalculated based on past harvested volumes and most recent forecasts.

#### Option 1: Direct Volume Extraction Estimation

Step 1: Identify the wood product class(es) (*ty*; defined here as sawnwood, wood-based panels, other industrial roundwood, paper and paper board, and other) that are the anticipated end use of the extracted carbon calculated in Step 2.

Step 2: Calculate the biomass carbon of the volume extracted by wood product type *ty* from within the project boundary:

# APPENDIX 2: ACTIVITY METHOD

### Introduction and approach

The positive list analysis described below was originally conducted only for the United States and, therefore, version 1.0 of VM0033 *Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration* limited the use of the activity method to this country; projects located in all other countries were required to apply the project method. The update to *VM0007 REDD Methodology Framework* to version 1.6 expanded its applicability to tidal wetland restoration and conservation activities. As part of this update, a new additionality module was created that expanded the original activity penetration analysis conducted for VM0033, version 1.0, to be applicable to be globally applicable. This analysis is described in the module *VMD0052 Demonstration of Additionality of Tidal Wetland Restoration and Conservation Project Activities*.

Many of the updates to *VM0007 REDD Methodology Framework* to expand its applicability to tidal wetland conservation and restoration, including the tool *VMD0052 Demonstration of Additionality of Tidal Wetland Restoration and Conservation Project Activities,* were based largely on VM0033. The updates to VM0033 in version 1.2 were to align it with some changes or additions made during the VM0007 update process.

The original positive list analysis is presented below. The full activity method analysis is provided in the module VMD0052*,* which must be used to demonstrate additionality in conjunction with this methodology.

#### Original analysis

Tidal wetland restoration activities in the United States are at a low level of penetration relative to their maximum adoption potential. Specifically, the activity penetration level of such activities is 2.74% (or lower), as demonstrated below. This level is below the 5% threshold specified in the *VCS Standard*. Therefore*,* tidal wetland restoration projects meeting the applicability conditions of this methodology and occurring within the 35 coastal states, commonwealths or territories of the United States of America are deemed additional*.*

Activity penetration is given as:

*APy* = *OAy* / *MAPy*

Where:

| $APy$ | = | Activity penetration of the project activity in year y (percentage) |
|-------|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-------|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

*OAy* = Observed adoption of the project activity in year y

{120}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_120_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### *MAPy* = Maximum adoption potential of the project activity in year y

In determining the activity penetration for tidal wetlands, it is necessary to address seagrass meadows and other tidal wetlands separately due to how these ecosystems are treated in the data sources.

For tidal wetland restoration (excluding seagrass meadows) in the United States, these terms are further defined as follows:

*OAy* = The average annual aggregate of tidal wetlands restored from 2000 to 2013 as reported by the 28 National Estuary Programs (NEPs) and their partners to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (measured in acreage), and expanded to include restoration activities that occur in a U.S. estuary that is not an NEP.

*MAPy* = The sum of the following:

- A portion of the 1991 100-year Coastal Floodplain as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
- Past tidal wetland losses to shallow open water in Louisiana due to coastal erosion
- Tidal wetland losses reported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) from 1991 to 2013

For seagrass meadow restoration in the United States, these terms are defined as follows:

- *OAy* = The percentage of seagrass meadow restoration projects compared to other estuary restoration projects funded by NOAA since 2000.
- *MAPy* = The estimated acreage of seagrass meadow losses in the U.S.

#### Justification for Tidal Wetland Restoration Penetration Levels (Non-Seagrass)

The United States is a developed country where states have equal access to the nation's resources. Factors causing degradation are substantially the same throughout the United States. Climate is not a factor in degradation of tidal wetlands, which occur across all climatic regions in the United States.

No complete national data sets exist for either tidal wetland loss or restoration in the United States. However, for both MAPy and OAy, conservative approximations can be made by examining the data from several sources.

#### Time Period

The time period selected for determining the OAy is 2000 to 2013. This is an appropriate time period for the following reasons:

{121}------------------------------------------------

- The NEPs began reporting annual activities in 2000 and have been required to do so since 1993 by the Government Performance Results Act. The NEP database captures activities prior to 2000 as well as those from 2000 forward.
- The Estuary Restoration Act<sup>49</sup> was signed into law in 2000. The Act made restoring estuaries a national priority and represents a recognition of the growing importance of estuary habitat restoration, including tidal wetlands. It provided funding authorization and appropriations for restoration projects, and created a federal interagency council to promote a coordinated Federal approach to estuary habitat restoration; forge effective partnerships among public agencies and between the public and private sectors; provide financial and technical assistance for estuary habitat restoration projects; and, develop and enhance monitoring and research capabilities. Prior to 2000, the lack of interagency coordination created sporadic and uncoordinated restoration actions.
- NOAA's Community-based Restoration Program was created in 1999 within its Restoration Center and began funding projects that year with just \$500,000 in funding50. The creation of this national center for restoration also indicates that a turning point for restoration was anticipated at that time. Since then, NOAA's annual funding for restoration has grown to well over 10 million dollars.
- Restore America' Estuaries (RAE) was established in 1997 as a national umbrella organization for regional non-profit organizations. These organizations identified estuary restoration as an emerging opportunity and established RAE to promote estuary restoration at the national level and to provide financial support for new restoration activities. The creation of RAE at this time reflects the need for a national voice to catalyze increased investment in estuary restoration.

Collectively these milestones represented a sea change in the restoration community that has greatly increased funding and capacity for restoration activities since the year 2000, and therefore the time period 2000 to 2013 will capture the preponderance of restoration activities.

#### Activity Penetration

The 28 National Estuary Programs are an appropriate means to quantify restoration activity. The National Estuary Program (NEP) was established under Section 320 of the 1987 Clean Water Act as a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program to protect and restore the water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries of national significance. The NEP consists of 28 individual estuary programs in the United States. Each NEP has a Management Conference consisting of diverse stakeholders including citizens, local, state and federal agencies, as well as non-profit and private sector interests. They emphasize a collaborative approach to establishing and implementing locally-based Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMP).

<sup>49</sup> http://www.era.noaa.gov/information/act.html

<sup>50</sup> Personal communication in 2000 with the Restoration Center Director, James Burgess.

{122}------------------------------------------------

The 28 estuaries with NEPs are the most advanced in conservation planning and implementation, including ecological restoration, and as such will have the greatest activity penetration levels of estuaries in the United States. They are also among the largest and most populated estuary regions in the U.S. Estuaries not included in the NEP will typically have a much lower penetration level for tidal wetland restoration.

That estuaries in NEPs face the same or similar barriers to implementation of tidal wetland restoration projects as estuaries that do not have an NEP is supported by the expert opinions supporting this document. The experts also confirm that the levels of restoration in NEPs are much greater than the levels of restoration occurring in non-NEP estuaries in the United States.

To undertake tidal wetland restoration requires significant scientific, regulatory and ecological expertise, substantial financial resources, cooperating partners, and the ability to make long-term commitments. As a participating estuary, each of the 28 NEPs receive strong federal and state financial assistance and programmatic support in these areas - support which non-NEP estuaries do not receive.

Moreover, because the NEPs are collaborative partnerships of agencies, organizations, businesses, and others, the data reported for each NEP represents a comprehensive reporting of the restoration and creation activities undertaken by the partners. This demonstrates that the 28 NEPs are an appropriate measure of the most significant observed restoration activities in the U.S.

Additional project activities occur in non-NEP estuaries. To account for these activities, a corrective factor equal to the ratio of NEP estuary land area to non-NEP estuary land area is applied. The land area of the contiguous U.S. is 2,961,266 square miles51. Coastal counties represent 17% of this area52. Therefore, coastal counties in the contiguous U.S. cover approximately 503,415 square miles of land (17% of geographic extent). The land area of the 28 NEPs is 246,338 square miles53. The ratio of land area in NEPs to total land area of coastal counties is 49% (246,338/503,415). Because the NEPs represent the most advanced and most supported estuary programs (see expert opinions below), we discount the non-NEP estimate by 50%. A correction factor of 50% therefore more than adequately captures activity in the non-NEP estuaries and the total OAy is equal to 1.5 times the OAy for NEPs.

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains an on-line database of projects reported by the 28 NEPs. Four years of data were reviewed to calculate an average rate of adoption for 2009 through 2012, which was then applied to the 2000 to 2014 period. This time period includes a one-time, significant infusion of federal government funding for estuary restoration in 2009. Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received \$165 million for projects, which had to be completed within 12-18

months. This one-time investment in restoration is highly unusual over the past 14 years (since the NEP data was first captured in 2000). Including this anomalous year in establishing an average adoption rate for the selected time period is a conservative approach to estimating activity penetration because it yields an average rate of restoration that is higher than the most likely rate, and applies that rate to the entire time period for determining OAy.

All United States estuaries face a common set of barriers to tidal wetland restoration including insufficient funding, lack of willing landowners and community support, and physical and ecological limitations and changes, such as sea level rise (Vigmostad et al 2005, Restore America's Estuaries and the Estuarine Research Federation, undated). In 2000, recognizing the critical need to provide funding for estuary habitat restoration, including tidal wetlands, and help to counter the mentioned socio-economic factors, the United States Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law, the Estuary Act of 2000, which authorized \$275 million over five years for restoration activities.

#### OA*y* Method of Analysis

*OAy* for the NEPs was determined through a systematic review of the data sets provided by the EPA for each of the NEPs. In reviewing each data set, the analysis only includes project acreage resulting from projects, which (1) are not required by any rule, regulation, law, statute, court settlement or other mandatory action and (2) meet the definition of tidal wetland restoration provided in this methodology. Where a project description included multiple habitat types (e.g., tidal wetland, shoreline, agriculture, etc.) and/or the project description included one or more activities in addition to restoration (e.g., acquisition and barrier removal), the entire project acreage was included in the calculation. This is conservative because it will lead to a higher activity penetration. The NEP *OAy* calculation is provided in Table 4.

Maximum Adoption Potential

To determine *MAPy*, an estimate of the available area for tidal wetland restoration needs to be established. The starting point for this estimate is the "Projected Impact of Relative Sea Level Rise on the National Flood Insurance Program" prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA 1991). FEMA calculated the area of coastal floodplain that would flood under a 100-year coastal flood

{125}------------------------------------------------

event for 1990 to be 19,500 mi<sup>2</sup> (12,800,000 acres). A 100-year flood event is defined as a flood that statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. By definition, the coastal floodplain does not include either upland areas or existing wetland areas (wetland areas do not flood because they are already regularly inundated). The coastal floodplain consists substantially of former wetland areas that were drained and/or filled and converted to other land uses, such as agricultural, commercial, or residential uses. This area includes many but not all former tidal wetland areas that were diked or drained for agriculture and other uses (some former wetland areas are no longer in the floodplain as they are now well protected by dikes or levees, e.g., and therefore are not included in this estimate, which is conservative). Not all of the coastal floodplain area identified by FEMA is restorable or suitable for wetland creation. But for establishing an estimate of *MAPy*, 33% of this area (4,224,000 acres) is used as a conservative (low) estimate.

The FEMA estimate was made in 1991 and only includes land areas subject to flooding. Therefore, we also include in the *MAPy* tidal wetland losses since 1991 and tidal wetlands that have drowned or converted to open water in coastal Louisiana. Virtually all of these areas are suitable for tidal wetland restoration.

Louisiana wetland losses from 1900 to 1978 are reported to be 901,200 acres (U.S. Department of the Interior 1994). The *MAPy* estimate does not include Louisiana coastal wetland losses between 1978 and 1986, and it is conservative to exclude that area from the *MAPy*.

Tidal wetland losses from 1986 to 1997 were reported to be 8,450 acres (Dahl 2000). The 1991 to 1997 portion of these losses is assumed to be 4,225 acres, a pro-rated portion of the total.

Tidal wetland losses from 1998 to 2004 were reported to be 32,400 acres (Dahl 2006).

Tidal wetland losses from 2004 to 2009 were reported to be 124,290 acres (Dahl 2011).

No data exists for 2010 to 2013 (four years). We apply the average rate of loss from the previous five year period, 2004 to 2009, which is 124,290 acres /6 years = 20,715 acres /year.

#### Justification for Seagrass Meadow Restoration Penetration Levels

#### *OAy* Method of Analysis

Seagrass meadow restoration also occurs at a very low level relative to its maximum adoption level in the U.S. Evidence of this is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which maintains a Restoration Atlas (NOAA 2014). NOAA is the lead federal agency mandated with coastal and marine fisheries habitat restoration and protection, including seagrass meadow habitat. NOAA's level of funding for seagrass meadow restoration is therefore a sufficient estimate of the total level of seagrass restoration.

The NOAA database contains information on about 2,701 habitat projects that have occurred since 2000, and only 120, or 4%, are seagrass meadow projects. The database includes numerous habitats (e.g., dune, in-stream, kelp, mangrove, oyster reef) as well as numerous activities in wetland habitats (restoration, invasive species removal, marine debris removal). Only a portion of the 120 seagrass meadow projects would meet the applicability conditions of this methodology. Therefore, including all of identified seagrass meadow restoration projects is conservative. The total acreage of estuary habitat restoration projects in the NOAA database is 49,837 acres. Seagrass meadow projects are typically conducted at a smaller scale than other habitat activities; therefore assuming that 4% of the total acreage can be attributed to seagrass restoration is conservative. The *OAy* for seagrass restoration is therefore  $4%$  of  $49,837 = 1,993$  acres.

#### Maximum Adoption Potential Method of Analysis for Seagrass Restoration

Waycott *et al* (2009) demonstrated that seagrass meadow habitat losses in the U.S. were 853,845 acres between 1937 and 2006. The primary causes of the loss of seagrass meadows – sediment deposition, declining water quality, scarring from vessels, and disease – are typically reversible. Therefore, all of the area documented as lost is restorable. *MAPy* for seagrass meadow restoration is therefore 853,845 acres.

#### Activity Penetration Calculation for Seagrass Restoration

*APy* = *OAy* / *MAPy APy* = 1,993 / 853,845 = 0.2%.

#### EXPERT OPINION I

Debbie L. DeVore Gulf Coast Restoration Program Manager U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service

Question 1 - To what extent do estuaries without a National Estuary Program face the same barriers to tidal wetland restoration activities as estuaries, which are part of a National Estuary Program? We have identified the following barriers, among others: funding, land ownership/control, political will, a local environment, which encourages partnerships, and social acceptability. Please note that we only need to consider barriers to tidal wetland restoration where it has already been identified as possible in the landscape. Based on your experience and expert judgment, do estuaries in NEPs face the same or similar barriers to implementation of tidal wetland restoration projects as estuaries that do not have an NEP? Please explain.

#### Answer:

While there are, no doubt, advantages afforded an estuary which has an established National Estuary Program (NEP) this does not preclude or exempt projects in these geographies from many of the same hurdles that projects face in an estuary outside the geographic of an NEP.

For example, funding is commonly the largest limiting factor in bringing a tidal restoration project to implementation, regardless of the project's location. Projects with involvement from an NEP must apply for the same limited funding as any other project (raising the same amount of match, etc.) and be held to the same reporting and fiduciary responsibilities as well. NEP supported projects must also go through the same scrutiny to obtain regulatory permission to conduct work, just as a non-NEP project does.

{129}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_129_Picture_1.jpeg)

Both political will and public support for projects are also similar issues faced by projects both within an NEP and outside a NEP geography. In fact, projects with NEP support or in a NEP geography may even sometimes have a bigger stigma as the public may not have a high level of trust for governmental organizations and be much less supportive of their actions. As well, working with landowners (particularly private landowners) may prove more difficult for projects with an governmental agency connection.

Tidal restoration projects and activities, while often a high priority based upon the result of natural resource partners coming together for a common restoration objective, are not necessarily given special preference towards implementation simply because they are facilitated by such a collaboration. These projects are held to the same standards (and hence work through the same barriers and hurdles) as projects in a non-NEP geography.

Question 2 – How likely is it that the rates of restoration in National Estuary Programs are greater than the rates of restoration occurring in non-NEP estuaries in the U.S.? It is our assumption that NEPs will have an overall higher rate of restoration than other estuaries because NEPs benefit from a shared state and federal commitment to estuary health, which may be absent in other estuaries. Moreover, because of the status of being an NEP, they are more likely to receive scarce federal and state resources, as well as funding from other partners. NEPs are multi-stakeholder collaborative efforts that are not found in other estuaries in the U.S. Based on your experience and expert judgment, are NEPs substantially likely to have a higher rate of restoration than non-NEP estuaries? Please explain.

#### Answer:

Although I may paint a picture of hard times for NEPs above - having to jump through the same regulatory hoops as other projects - that is part of doing business in coastal restoration. NEPs and their restoration partners understand this and support that we should be held to the same regulatory and accountability standards as projects in non-NEP geographies or with no connection to the Program itself. NEPs and their partners do, however, recognize the tremendous benefit to a voluntary, collaborative and strategic approach to tidal restoration (as well as other coastal conservation issues NEPs address). Many funding agencies give credit to project proponents who work as a collective multistakeholder partnership. There is an assumption that such a partnership represents an agreed upon set of goals, objectives, implementation procedures and monitoring for a given project. This gives a funding agency a certain level of confidence that the project will be successful and supported at a local level. Project proposals written by NEP partners are also often more well defined and in concert with requested information outlined in a funding opportunity.

To answer your question specifically, yes, I do think NEPs have a higher likelihood of receiving funds for coastal restoration. I say this for a few reasons. In today's world of limited federal and state budgets and fewer dollars to put "on-the-ground" for projects, the conservation community has been pushed to become much more strategic in our thinking. By this I mean that we are looking at how projects fit into the larger watershed or landscape, we strive to accomplish as many partners' goal and objectives as possible, and we must leverage our funds as much as we possibly can. The NEP structure, their

{130}------------------------------------------------

associated advisory committees and public outreach capabilities, lends itself to a role in facilitating such a strategic approach.

I worked for the FWS Coastal Program nearly 10 years and can say that for many of the reasons I described above, our Program encourages and actively engages in partnership with our local NEPs. In my tenure with the Coastal Program I have worked with NEPs in both Texas and Florida. When possible, our Program staff serve on technical advisory committees, participate in strategic planning and assist in project implementation. In fact, I was involved in drafting the current Strategic Plan for our southwest Florida focal area where I identified working with the NEPs as a priority for our Program. When appropriate and feasible, the Coastal Program has and continues to invest funding towards projects such as tidal restoration activities.

#### EXPERT OPINION II

Curtis Tanner Acting Manager, Environmental Restoration and Assessment Division U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 18 November 2013

Steve Emmet-Mattox Senior Director for Strategic Planning and Programs Restore America's Estuaries Dear Steve:

I am writing in response to your September 23, 2013, email requesting my expert opinion regarding tidal wetland restoration and greenhouse gas offsets. As you know, I have over twenty years of experience working on coastal wetland restoration and protection for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The views expressed in this letter are based on my own experience and perspective, and do not reflect an official agency position. I have attached a copy of my current resume for your use in assessing my credentials.

As I understand it, you are working to establish the viability of tidal wetland restoration as a tool for use in sequestering carbon dioxide to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. You seek to establish the fact that at a National scale, tidal wetland restoration in the United States is limited in spatial scale and impact. Specifically, "activity penetration", or the prevalence of restoration project implementation relative to the opportunity for tidal wetland restoration, is relatively small. In your assessment of tidal restoration in the U.S., you estimate the "…Activity Penetration is 1.06%, which is less than 5%, and therefore tidal wetland restoration in the U.S. is additional…" as defined by the Verified Carbon Standard. In short, you assert that given the relatively small amount of tidal wetland restoration in the U.S. (as compared to opportunity and demonstrated need), investment in restoration would provide a viable alternative for carbon offset funds. I concur with your assessment.

Your analysis relied upon the most comprehensive data set available at the National level for tidal wetland restoration, accomplishment reporting from the National Estuary Program (NEP). You have specifically requested that I provide an assessment based on my experience and expert judgment whether use of these data are appropriate. First, you have asked whether estuaries covered by the NEP provide a representative sample, facing the same or similar barriers to tidal wetland restoration project

{132}------------------------------------------------

implementation. Based on 20+ years of experience working on coastal restoration and protection issues and projects, it is my opinion that tidal wetland restoration is typically limited by a set of barriers common to estuaries throughout the United States; funding, land owner willingness, and social acceptability are nearly universal challenges for all projects and estuaries. Taken together as a whole, the geographic distribution of NEP sites provides a broad cross section of National estuarine ecosystem conditions, encompassing a range of ecological threats, fish and wildlife resource assets, and socio/political contexts. This representative diversity applies to both human and non-human aspects of coastal ecosystems.

Second, you post the question as to whether the rate of restoration derived from analysis of NEP estuaries is representative. As I understand your analysis, if NEP estuaries had a substantially lower rate of restoration than non-NEP estuaries, your activity penetration estimate of 1.06%, as compared the VCS threshold of 5%, could be challenged. Based on my experience derived from project implementation and program management, NEP estuaries likely deliver a higher rate of restoration as compared to non-NEP estuaries, if significant differences do in fact exist. I base this assertion on observations of the opportunity space provided for restoration that NEP designation provides coastal ecosystems. The Clean Water Act directs each NEP to develop and implement a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP). Agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service respond to policies and Congressional funding directives to focus restoration efforts in NEP systems, often in response to the CCMP. NEP designation also works to focus the work of state agency, tribal government, and non-governmental organization partners to address restoration needs defined by the CCMP. In Puget Sound, development and implementation of the CCMP is the role of the Puget Sound Partnership (PSP), a Washington State cabinet-level agency. PSP has led development of the current CCMP for Puget Sound, referenced as the "Action Agenda". PSP's Action Agenda includes specific targets for estuarine restoration required to recover the health of Puget Sound. Other non-NEP coastal ecosystems in Washington State lack this political focus and dedicated state and National funding for tidal wetland restoration.

In summary, while I have not provided a detailed review of your data sources and analysis, I am familiar with the approach you have applied in your analysis. NEP estuaries provide applicable data set for your assessment of activity penetration for restoration. CCMP's for NEP estuaries provide a numeric objective for restoration and thus a quantifiable estimate of opportunity and need. Accomplishment reporting required by U.S. EPA delivers an accounting of acres restored which can be compared to numeric targets. The 28 NEP systems distributed throughout the United States provide a representative cross section of coastal ecosystems and the challenges and opportunities faced by restoration projects proponents. NEP designation leads to a regional focus of efforts, that delivers activity penetration rates likely equal or greater than that of non-NEP systems.

Thank-you for the opportunity to provide my perspective on your assessment. Please contact me directly if you have questions or if I can be of additional assistance.

Sincerely, Curtis D. Tanner Original request to expert:

From: Steve Emmett-Mattox Sent: Monday, September 23, 2013 1:42 PM To: 'Tanner, Curtis' Subject: expert guidance sought, Restore America's Estuaries tidal wetland restoration and ghg offsets

Dear Mr. Tanner,

Restore America's Estuaries is seeking to demonstrate the "additionality" of tidal wetland restoration in the U.S. for the purposes of generating carbon offsets under the Verified Carbon Standard. The VCS revised its rules in 2012 to include a standardized approach to demonstrate additionality. In order to comply with this approach, RAE has assembled a substantial data set and analysis. The data, analysis and discussion are attached. In a recent review by the VCS, they raised two questions that we would like your help in answering. I believe you to be an expert in tidal wetland restoration activities in the U.S., and now seek your opinion on the following:

1 – to what extent do estuaries without a National Estuary Program face the same barriers to tidal wetland restoration activities as estuaries, which are part of a National Estuary Program? We have identified the following barriers, among others: funding, land ownership/control, political will, a local environment, which encourages partnerships, and social acceptability. Please note that we only need to consider barriers to tidal wetland restoration where it has already been identified as possible in the landscape. Based on your experience and expert judgment, do estuaries in NEPs face the same or similar barriers to implementation of tidal wetland restoration projects as estuaries that do not have an NEP? Please explain.

2 – how likely is it that the rates of restoration in National Estuary Programs are greater than the rates of restoration occurring in non-NEP estuaries in the U.S.? It is our assumption that NEPs will have an overall higher rate of restoration than other estuaries because NEPs indicate a shared state and federal commitment to estuary health, which may be absent in other estuaries. Moreover, because of the status of being an NEP, they are more likely to receive scarce federal and state resources, as well as funding from other partners. NEPs are multi-stakeholder collaborative efforts that are not found in other estuaries in the U.S. Based on your experience and expert judgment, are NEPs substantially likely to have a higher rate of restoration than non-NEP estuaries? Please explain.

And last, please provide an up to date resume/CV, which we will share with the VCS.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this request, and thank you for your timely response.

Cheers, Steve Emmett-Mattox Senior Director for Strategic Planning and Programs Restore America's Estuaries
