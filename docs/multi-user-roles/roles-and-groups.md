### 2. Groups

Groups are separate sets of documents access , which can be limited to users who are members of the group.

**Note**: A user can be included into any number of groups with a single role within each. User roles can be different in different groups.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Switching between Groups

When a policy contains multiple groups, users have an option to switch between those they are included in. The selection menu also allows to switch to the â€˜no groupâ€™ default state, i.e. the state in which the user is not acting as a member of any group.
