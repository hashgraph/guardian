| W3C Decentralized Identifier             | W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.                                        |
| W3C DID Document                         | A W3C DID Document expresses cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Services enable trusted interactions associated with the DID subject.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| W3C Verifiable Credential                | A W3C Verifiable Credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Credential Verifier                      | An entity that cryptographically and schematically verifies the conformance of a W3C Verifiable Credential with the W3C Verifiable Credential standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| W3C Verifiable Presentation              | A Verifiable Presentation expresses data from one or more verifiable credentials, and is packaged in such a way that the authorship of the data is verifiable.

| Policy Workflow                          | The execution of a series of causally connected and deterministic policy actions where the policy workflow or policy action participants are grouped into one or more workgroups that are attached to policy action of a policy workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
