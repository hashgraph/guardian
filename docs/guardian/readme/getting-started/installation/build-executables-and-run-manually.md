# ðŸ”¨ Build executables and run manually

If you want to manually build every component with debug information, then build and run the services and packages in the following sequence: Interfaces, Logger Helper, Message Broker, Logger Service, Auth Service, IPFS, Guardian Service, UI Service, and lastly, the MRV Sender Service. See below for commands.

### Prerequisites for Manual Installation

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) ,
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* [Nats](https://nats.io/)

#### Build and start each component

Install, configure and start all the prerequisites, then build and start each component.

#### Services Configuration:

*   for each of the services create the file `./<service_name>/.env` to do this copy, past and rename the file `./<service_name>/.env.template`

    For example:

    in `./guardian-service/.env`:

    ```plaintext
        GUARDIAN_ENV="develop"
    ```

    If need to configure OVERRIDE uncomment the variable in file `./guardian-service/.env`:

    ```plaintext
        OVERRIDE="false" 
    ```
*   configure the file `./<service_name>/configs/.env.<service>.<GUARDIAN_ENV>` file: to do this copy, past and rename the file `./<service_name>/.env.<service>.template`

    following previous example:

    in `./guardian-service/configs/.env.guardian.develop`:

```plaintext
OPERATOR_ID="..."
OPERATOR_KEY="..."
```

*   Setting up Chat GPT API KEY to enable AI Search and Guided Search:

    For setting up AI and Guided Search, we need to set OPENAI\_API\_KEY variable in `./ai-service/configs/.env*` files.

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
    ```
