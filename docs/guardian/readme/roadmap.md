#### --— August 2025 ----

**Payload Shapefile Ingestion**

Make the payload ingest shapefiles, KML etc.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5046](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5046)

Documentation Link: [https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/schemas/how-to-handle-large-location-files](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/schemas/how-to-handle-large-location-files)

**Improvement in the error handling for excel schema imports​**

To have better validation when excel is imported into guardian which will help prevent all the points I mentioned above and some more that I probably missed while working on methodology digitization

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4755](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4755)

**Dry-run savepoint\[s] to survive exit and policy editing**

1. Make savepoints 'survive' multiple "exit dry-run -> edit policy -> execute dry-run" cycles such that policy authors would not have to enter values in fields again on subsequent dry-runs.
2. Enable to existence of multiple 'savepoints' per policy
3. Enable policy authors to choose when savepoint to apply on each policy dry-run session.
4. Users can clean-up savepoints by deleting them individually, or choosing to 'Delete All'

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5056](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5056)

Documentation Link: [https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/policies/savepoints/demo-using-ui](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/policies/savepoints/demo-using-ui)

**Locations Data Field enhancement**

Validation Check: Implement a validation step to confirm that location data being passed to the policy is in polygon format (e.g., Polygon or MultiPolygon in GeoJSON).

Data Format Enforcement: Ensure that only valid polygon geometry types are accepted. Reject or flag submissions that use unsupported formats (e.g., Point, LineString, or malformed geometries).

GeoJSON Handling (Optional Enhancement): Explore and, if feasible, implement a conversion method to extract the location GeoJSON and convert it into a downloadable file format (e.g., .geojson or .json).

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5061](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5061)

**SLA Ticket Import and Policy Publish Performance in Guardian**

Investigate bottlenecks in the SLA Ticket Import process:

* File parsing and validation
* Schema mapping and VC generation
* Backend processing queues

Optimize the policy publishing process:

* Reduce the time to publish policies with SLA blocks
* Improve processing time for VC issuance and anchor creation on Hedera
* Implement batch processing or lazy loading where applicable

Evaluate and optimize:

* MongoDB write operations
* Hedera anchoring transaction handling
* Large file buffer management
* Provide loading indicators and progress status updates to the user

Add backend logs/metrics to measure:

* SLA import time
* VC issuance time
* Total policy publishing duration

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5120](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5120)

#### --— September ----

**Validation for project data submission**

Validation Rules Enhancement\
Implement robust validation for schema fields in both UI-level form inputs and backend processing logic for key field types:

* GeoJSON: Ensure that the data is a valid FeatureCollection or Geometry object following RFC 7946 standards.
* IPFS Links: Ensure that the link is not empty and follows proper CID or ipfs:// format.

Error Handling and Feedback

* Inform the user with clear error messages during submission if data fails validation.
* Prevent submission if any required or format-sensitive fields are invalid.

Backward Compatibility Handling

* Optionally, mark or flag previously submitted documents with invalid data for review or correction.

Unit and Integration Tests

* Add test cases to ensure all validations work across various scenarios and edge cases

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5060](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5060)

#### Add an option to hide some buttons in case the policy is discontinued

* Policy developers can flag a button as available only if the policy is not discontinued.
* Buttons flagged as _hide/WhenDiscontinued_ won't be displayed in the webUI when the policy is discontinued

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4067](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4067)

**Guardian Form UI Improvements**

These four can be made into their individual issues as well. Let me know, I'd be happy to submit four separate ones.

1. Support a table input(and csv import) field for multi-year data fields. Often methodologies require multi-year inputs(think 10 or 100 year) and it's not the easiest to visualize or input them with a typical form UI. It'd be good to have a way to have tabular inputs and a way to specify how they will be read within calculations code.
2. Support attachments to a field (justifications, report). Corresponding to a submitted field, a VVB or SR may ask for justification report which is usually a file. A similar issue is already there - [Manual input of additional data for inclusion into the VC document #2076](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2076)
3. For large documents for example PDD, it'd be good to divide them into sections when user is submitting. We must allow draft saves and make dry-run testing feasible. Such a feature already exists(tabbed/navigation UI), but if document is too big, policy developer needs to click test data button multiple times to fill the entire form.
4. GeoJSON/Shapefiles rendering - Allow file uploads of such types and they should be rendered with maps in best way in form UI.

**Make testing easier for subflows**

There should be a way to test the sub-flows similar to unit test paradigm we have in programming. Each unit should be individually runnable and testable. Following the entire workflow for testing takes up \~50-60% of time of policy development.

#### --— October ----

**Complex iterative review and approval workflows​**

Introduce `reviewVcDocumentBlock` as a complement to the `requestVcDocumentBlock` into Policy definition language and corresponding Guardian UI tools which would facilitate complex iterative document review workflows supporting rich communications, namely the ability to:

* send messages/descriptions associated with actions
* conduct stand-alone (not action-linked) message exchanges (questions, responses, general comms)
* send requests for providing additional documents/evidence, and provide facilities to upload/receive them
* ability to edit/correct previously submitted (but rejected) document and resubmit again
* forward messages to another user
* involve other users into 'conversations'

These actions, steps, message exchanges have to be verifiably traceable, i.e. recorded and published as VC/VP documents alongside the usual data-containing documents produce by the policy workflows.

**Policy warnings**

* Introduce the generic capability to highlight blocks, elements within them, and groups of blocks
* Introduce the generic capability to produce and display warning/error/info messages, their numbers and ability to disable/resolve:
  * ignore (this one)
  * ignore all like this
* Add the corresponding API capability to access and manage the warnings etc via API

**Schema deletion with child schemas**

Implement a safe way to delete all schemas embedded into the parent schema in one operation such that:

* the system check whether the schemas embedded into the parent schema being deleted are used anywhere else, and if so prevents the delete operation
* users can select whether to delete all embedded schema together with the parent one or not before the deletion

**Implementing Artifacts such as Schemas/Policies/tokens Deletion all at once​**

1. Create a checkbox at the top of the schema/policy/token table, which will allow to select all the artifacts.
2. Once, all the schemas/policies/tokens are selected, and clicked on delete, we should be able to delete all the schemas/policies/tokens at once

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3375](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3375)

**Option to delete all schemas for a particular policy in Draft stage​**

There may be another solution/improvement to the excel where it checks for duplicates and provides with an option to replace. Similar to the file system in macOS for example where it doesnt allow 2 folders with the same name at a particular destination. Issue for that created here: [#4754](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4754)

**Import Excel to check for duplicates by schema name​**

But I believe there is one more check which the guardian can do when the excel is imported and that is to check for duplicates and provide the user with an option to either replace the schema or keep both the files.

**Project Account Wallet (ex:Project Developer or Accountable Impact Organisation)**

* Each new Project must have a unique wallet address generated/associated upon creation.
* The Project wallet must support:
  * Receiving funds (Hedera tokens/HBAR)
  * Sending funds (to users, vendors, or community members)
  * Holding and managing tokens (if applicable)
  * Transactions must be traceable back to the Project wallet for reporting/financial audit.

**Need to implement best practices on Schema Cycle**

We need to implement and document best practices covering the following aspects of the schema lifecycle:

Schema Design & Format Guidance

* Explain how to design schemas that align with Guardian requirements.
* Describe valid formats and structure (e.g., JSON Schema).
* Outline file format expectations for importing into Guardian.

Manual Schema Creation in Guardian

* Step-by-step process to create schemas directly in the Guardian UI.
* Include tips for defining required fields, types, and constraints.
* Emphasize validation logic to reduce submission errors.

Schema Mapping

* When and why to map schemas.
* Best practices for setting up mapping relationships (if applicable).
* Examples of mapped vs. unmapped use cases.

### ---November---

**Graphical View of formula linked definitions**

* Add the capability to display dependencies and relationships of data feeding into Formula definitions as a diagram similar to 'schema tree view' or 'statistics'.
* Color code (or in other way identify) the data points based on:
  * their values (missing/default/as suggested/not-null)
  * type (data structure/scalar value)
  * in the future other criteria (e.g. "outside of 'normal' range")

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4730](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4730)

**Capture/replay and compare data of published policies**

Introduce the capability to record and publish 'runs' of the policy for published policies such that it would be possible to replay these runs locally (in dry-run mode) and compare the results.

Additionally the runs need to be secured as a certified artifact which can be undeniably attributed to an instance of the Guardian and Standard Registry in it. Thus it would provides additional execution environment verification tool for auditors etc potentially other interested parties.

Make the recording of the runs for published policies executions 'on' by default (which can be disabled by the user), with an option to publish the final 'runs' artifact on IPFS which is also 'on' by default.

#### Formula-linked definitions enhancements

1. "Name" column in formula records table should be wider. Now it's unreadable
2. After creating a formula record I need to find it in a list to edit. It's quite difficult according to point 1
3. On the top of a formula edit page I see button "Back to policies" but button redirects me to list of formulas
4. I cannot move a formula item when I'm scrolling the page. Drag-n-drop works only in visible part of screen and it's impossible to add const/variable and move it to the top of a long list
5. I cannot re-use constants which are defined in another formula in relationships. It makes me to define same constants in different formula records

### ---December---

#### Guardian as a multi-workflow engine for independent data streams

Guardian should be able to inject machine-readable product data and process them simultaneously in multiple independent Policy processing streams, each with an independent ruleset, however with the possibility to coordinate and cross reference the artifacts produced by these streams, all while maintaining and referencing the single original instance of the 'master' data.

1. Extend and adapt the topics architecture to support multi-workflow processing of the master data (from a topic)
2. Develop a multi-streams Guardian policy coordination mechanisms which were in a single instance and across different Guardian instances, which include
   * trigger workflow execution based on an event such as NFT issuance, data events.
   * pause and wait for the availability of specific data
3. Introduce additional (to token issuance) Guardian policy actions to enable 'final' stages of policy streams executions, such as:
   * payment execution
   * certificate (invoice, bill of lading, etc) issuance

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5018](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/5018)

#### Tamper-resistant Policy and Module export/import

* Introduce the signing of Policies and Policy Modules such that on import their authenticity is evaluated - which proves that they have not been tampered with.
* In an indicator into the Policy grid (or other appropriate place) which would show whether the Policies (and/or their elements such as schemas, modules etc) that have been imported (whether from the file system or IPFS) have been modified from their original state.
* Introduce the ability to compare all Policies which have been 'created' in the particular instance by import with their original 'just after import' state.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1887](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1887)

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4743](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4743)

#### Fine grained Policy workflow certification labels

Introduce the capability to select arbitrary sections of Policy workflows and then assign tags to them, which should result in these tags being visible whenever the policy sections or any artefacts produced in these sections are viewed by users such that:

* Policy sections can be selected and assessed/tagged after the policy is published
* Assessment/tagging can be done by users who are not policy authors
* Tags then applied retrospectively to artefacts produced by the 'target' section of the Policy (where the tag has been applied)
* Tags are visible whenever users view artefacts and/or policy in Guardian and Indexer, including trustchain view

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4534](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4534)

#### Extend Policy definition language to include a Formula calculations block​

Introduce a Formula calculation block which would:

* Allow Policy authors to input mathematical formulas directly into the policy (using Gurdian UI formula editor) in the standard mathematical notation ([https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/editor/](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/editor/))
* Enable policy authors to bind variables/parameters in these formulas to data (fields in schemas) for inputs/outputs to integrate the block into the Policy workflow
* At Policy run time perform the calculations directly without any additional input etc from users ([https://arthanzel.github.io/evaluatex/](https://arthanzel.github.io/evaluatex/))

Extend Guardian UI to:

* Whenever the result of such calculation is shown to the user to also display the formula definition in the standard math notation
* Also display the values of the variables/parameters in the formula which were used to calculate these results
* Enable users to navigate to the data sources of these values (used for the calculations) by providing links to the required levels dept.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4535](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4535)

#### On-demand state proof generation for critical Guardian operations

* Introduce the ability to trigger [Hedera State Proof ](https://hedera.com/blog/state-proofs-on-hedera)generation from Guardian interface for particular actions/operations or the general status of the Policy.
* State proofs are to be generated and presented to users for download. Guardian will not keep any registry or store them on the system.
* Introduce UI and the backend functionality to verify Hedera State Proofs generated by Guardian, ensure the long-term compatibility of this functionality.

2. Development of the schema and policy.
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.

**Scope 3/PCF Referencing Demo (Methodology Breakdown)**

Once the approach has been approved, we can update the GHGP policy and run the example data, publish the PCFs to the Hedera Network, and demonstrate how another guardian policy (of a supply chain partner) can reference a dynamic PCF to support scope 3 calculations. I believe Wes was interested in having this be a methodology breakdown.

**API facilities to retrieve unique references (IDs) of results for API-triggered operations**

* Design a generic approach to the 'traceability' of API calls such that for each API call a chain of events and actions within Guardian policy and especially to outside systems can be established via the unique IDs culminating in:
* Hedera transactions
* Hedera topics messages
* Hedera contract calls
* Artifacts published on IPFS
* Introduce a corresponding UI where users can visually observe the same information
* Consider packaging this into Interactions Resilience Module (see related [Hedera interactions resilience module #2905](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2905))

**Guardian analytics: labels and top down data way points**

* Introduce 2 new workflows into Guardian, which include the corresponding roles and access permissions:
  * labels author, for users to be able to create the 'rulesets' for evaluating data for their compliance with the chosen 'label',
  * auditor workflow, for users which would use these 'rulesets' to apply to data.
* Introduce the concept of labels, which can be specified to combine multiple statistics (introduced in [Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability #3336](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3336)) to create 'higher-order' statistics which themselves can be combined further essentially enabling the creation of 'data transformation' trees which, when applied to data, would ultimately get resolved into binary compliant/non-compliant answers. The top-level 'nodes' in these trees are 'Labels'.
* Enhance the current capability of qualitative evaluations in Statistics to support the ability for users to attach external evidence and add textual comments/explanations whenever a human input is enabled. The evidence would then become part of the 'evaluation trust-chain', i.e. it should be hashed and stored verifiably. Evidence in the image formats should be viewable in the browser, archives (zip files), pdfs, csv files should be supported for attachment and then download.
* Enable Auditors to apply 'label rulesets' to tokens, Guardian would then automatically traverse the token trust-chain to find and evaluate the required data to produce the label conclusion, i.e. the compliant/non-compliant results. These results can optionally be published to IPFS/topics by Auditors that generated them.
* Enable ordinary users to search for statistics, label ruleset, and label conclusions that have been published.

**GHGP Version 3**

Some items that could help take this policy to the next level would be to build out scope 3 and PCF referencing capabilities, build out SEC compliance aspects, and pursue a “Built on GHGP Mark” of approval. I believe this will help drive the policy to be attractive to real world users and ready for adoption.

**Formula Linked Definitions & Schema Tree Enhancement**

1. Introduce a UI component, or 2 separate but compatible components, into the Guardian which can display mathematical formulas in a format familiar to the user (like formulas in a LaTex documents of PDFs). These formulas should be interactive, i.e.:
   * at the viewing time individual elements of the formulas should be clickable so users can drill into the variables and see corresponding schemas/documents.
   * users should be able to input formulas (in a formula editor) of sufficient complexity to cover all VCM cases
   * users should be able to copy/paste entire formulas or parts thereof
2. Enable policy authors to map schema tree structures to formulas, linking the fields and variables so Guardian UI can display them as per point above
3. Enhance Guardian schema, policy and VC/VPs views to display the formulas whenever they are available.
4. Introduce the ability to attach a PDF file to the schemas/formulas at the policy/schema creation time, and specify the (external) 'origin' link so the original source of the math can be traced to the original paper.
5. Enhance schema tree view to display the formulas alongside schemas.

**Dry-run policy execution 'savepoints' - restart policy dry-run from the list of 'saved' places**

* Introduce a new functionality for users to 'save' dry-run execution status at arbitrary points by clicking 'save state' button.
* The system should support the creation of multiple save points for the same execution workflow
* Next time the (draft) policy is executed in the dry-run mode users should be given a choice whether to restart from the beginning or continue execution from any of the 'save points'.
* Starting execution from a 'save point' invalidates and removes all the other save points that logically followed it
* It should be possible to delete some or all save points manually

**Cross-context (API+UI) refresh token invalidation (regression from v2.18.0)**

Looking into the code, it seems that the refresh token should last for a year, this is fine as it is configurable, but losing login context (or a user potentially feeling they lost all their data) isn't great UX.

In terms of code behaviour, I would presume that this change would fix the issue:

```
const user = await new DataBaseHelper(User).findOne({refreshToken: decryptedToken.id, username: decryptedToken.name});
```

to

```
const user = await new DataBaseHelper(User).findOne({username: decryptedToken.name});
```

The reason why this _**might**_ be okay, is that the _expire at_ decoding happens on the line above, so a refresh token, would last for the period of time by default.

As this is authentication related, it requires review from more people.

**Business UseCase for Emissions Reduction/Removals (ERRs)Calculation Pre-Calculator in Guardian**

We are in the process of creating a few approaches to this ticket from the business use case perspective. One is essentially an “estimator” with a simplified workflow that can be used to estimate emission reductions, token issuance, etc. upfront to help the user better anticipate issuances and the impacts of various project activities and methodological choices. The other is more of a “summary preview” of the actual calculation results, that can be implemented just before validation (or anytime thereafter) to see summary KPIs based on the actual inputs and methodological choices made by the user, and they can then interact with the data like the Nerd Wallet retirement calculator to see how changes to the project activities could impact issuances. To be discussed further with the team.

**Weak Default configuration**

Change the password to a strong, random value, or create additional setup steps were the deployer is required to set this secrets. Additionally, set the most secure configuration as the default in the repository. This ensures that any user deploying the repository will benefit from enhanced security by default. In addition, as highlighted on the issue finding "Lack of Security Hardening Guides", a security guideline is recommended so that users can configure securely their environment before deploying it.

**System Logs Accessible by All Registries**

It is recommended to separate the system functionality from the registry functionality specifically for log management. Additionally, it would be appropriate to restrict access to system logs to a different admin role, who would only review the system logs. For registry logs, it is recommended to ensure that one registry can only view its logs, without seeing the logs of other registry users.

* Develop a UI for users to provide a Topic ID for one of the specific items below as an entry point into the 'vertical':
  * Policy
  * Standard registry
  * Token
* When manual re-indexing is scheduled it must take priority, or the rest should gets postponed until the manually-triggered update is finished.
* The user who triggered the update must be notified when the update is finished.

**Accessing a Guardian policy from a Guardian instance other than the publishing instance**

A Guardian user should be able to access a policy published by another Guardian instance from their own Guardian instance. This access should be based on a request-grant model.

#### ---- May 2025----

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Request Data module**

If the functionality is important enough to keep despite the risk, then all URLs should be requested through a secure proxy server. This is a significant effort, and to be secure the proxy must ensure that:

1. The URL does not resolve to a private or local IP address 2. Redirects are not followed
2. Only HTTP(S) protocol schemes are supported\
   Additionally, the application server should define and enforce rate limits to discourage abuse of the functionality as a web scanner.\
   If the application is hosted on AWS servers, enforce usage of AWS “Instance Metadata Service Version 2” with token usage required. This is a new AWS metadata API which severely curtails the ability of attackers to abuse SSRF to access the AWS metadata API. However, this will not prevent attacks against other internal services.

**Exporting Project Data in CSV format**

1. We should be able to export the complete project data of any policy in CSV format through Guardian.
2. We should also be able to apply filters to the project data, which should be included in the export file.
3. When we export the data in csv format, it should follow proper naming convention such as saving the exported file by its respective policy name\_version.csv

**Missing Authentication between Services**

It is recommended to implement mutual authentication for all internal microservice communications to ensure that each service can verify the identity of the other. It is recommended to ensure that each service is properly authenticated, using authorization roles and permissions to ensure that each service can only publish or consume messages in the queues relevant to its designated function. Moreover, messages could be digitally signed, ensuring they originate from the correct service. At each step in the process, the signatures can be verified to ensure that the message has not been tampered with. Where applicable, integrate these recommendations into the security hardening guide to ensure organizations deploying the application can implement these best practices effectively.

**No Password Policy**

It is recommended to create a password policy, that can be configured by the organizations using the application. It should also be noted that recent guidance from NCSC promotes password policies which are designed to decrease the burden on the user. This can include relaxing controls requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals in favor of the use of suitably complex passwords. The NCSC password guidance21 should be reviewed to determine if this new guidance can be applied to the environment reviewed.

**Guardian policy embedded code testing/debugging facility for Custom Logic, Calculate, etc blocks**

* Introduce the 'Test' button to all places where **source** or **math** code can be inputted in Guardian policy which would trigger the 'in place' execution of the code based on the execution context and defined inputs/outputs of the block. This tool could prompt the user for input data when required.
* Add ability to 'print' (i.e. log) data and variable values somewhere when test-running policy (e.g. in Dry-run mode). This way policy authors would be able to examine the data structures passed into the functions and identify unexpected behaviour in this area.
* Add recommendations to the documentation wrt running this code in an separate developer environment, i.e. all the needed execution context such as imported libraries etc so those developers who prefer to use their code editors can replicate the execution of the code there.

**Identifying, Implementing and Integrating 3rd Party data resources**

* Identify and shortlist 2-3 key Environmental-related data sources to be used as reference data and/or
* Implement integration with these 3rd party data providers (may be similar to IPFS/Hedera integration), such as:
* policy can easily add such 'integration' to their policy - potentially using the new policy modules functionality [Linkable policy modules for constructing end-to-end Policy workflows #1657](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1657)
* the data can be defined as mandatory or optional (by the policy author)
* data imported into Policy artifacts is stored and displayed in its native format, preserving 'mime type' and/or any other indication of the nature of the data as well as the identity/credentials of the source, time/date and other identifying information as appropriate

**Authorization Headers Potentially Leaked through IPFS in Request Data Module**

Implement a secure method to handle secrets in the Request Data module that ensures sensitive information, such as authorization headers, is not published with the policy. A possibility may be to include encrypted headers with the public key that only the private key of the policy owner can decrypt. Other possibility may be to store the secrets headers in the vault and fetch them at runtime using appropriate access controls. Update the documentation to explicitly warn policy creators about the risks of including sensitive information in the policies and recommend using the module only for public HTTP methods. Provide guidelines on securely configuring policies to avoid the leakage of sensitive data.

**Facilities to use specialist math tooling (such as R language) for calculations in Guardian Policies**

1. Introduce support for Python language **in** Policies such that Python code can be embedded into Policies and enable them to perform complex calculations in the course their execution by users
2. Bundle Python interpreter and a standard (curated) set of libraries into Guardian distros
3. Add 'Guardian version' parameter to the documents so any complex calculations can be replicated by knowing versions of libraries and interpreters used by the Policy at the document production time.
