## ---- January 2024----

## UI upgrade, AI search and project comparison

1. Improving Guardian UI by adding more UI elements and also adding more colorful headers which can be customized.
2. Creating a static landing page which will have capability of performing project comparison within same instance using different parameters such as scale size, sectoral scopes, etc.
3. Implementing AI search for allowing Project developers to search policies as per the information entered.
4. Implementing Guider Search for allowing project developers to search policies using different parameters within same instance.
5. Implementation of property field when schema is created, which will be used for standardizing as per IWA specification.

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

### Gold Standard‚Äôs Carbon Sequestration through Accelerated Carbonation of Concrete Aggregate Webinar

* Design schemas for the Carbon Sequestration through Accelerated Carbonation of Concrete Aggregate methodology, create a PowerPoint presentation, and conduct webinar.
* Development of the policy using the schemas and workflow designed

### Business User Policy Development Feature - schemas MVP

* Create a excel 'schema representation' standard suitable for non-technical users. _Note: use existing excel schemas from Tools and UNFCCC initiatives as guidance._
* Create an explicit template for the above, downloadable from Guardian UI, which users can take and update/change to develop new schemas.
* Create an Export/Import UI and tooling which would allow seamless transformation of schemas written in Excel into valid Guardian JSON schemas and vice versa
* Ensure manual interventions are possible for corrections/adjustments of complex formulas and other issues.

### Geographic raster imagery support in Guardian

Introduce support for geoTIFF and other raster types of data such that:

* Guardian documents (i.e. in schemas) can reference raster data (in geoTIFF and other common formats) which are located on external (3rd party) systems.
* Guardian UI can display raster images and their georeferencing data when they are encountered in documents.
* Guardian policy can access and manipulate (use in calculations, etc) data from raster sources.

## ---- February 2024----

### Support externally controlled DIDs with keys in Guardian

Introduce a workflow into the Guardian where a DID Controller would introduce a dedicated verification method into the main DID for which the private key would be stored and managed by a Guardian instance. This way Guardian would only be able to control the specific verification method's key, but not the rest of the DID.

### Live project (data) migration across Policies, across Guardian instances

Implement User Interface (UI) and tooling allowing users to execute multiple cycles of 'export a live project' from a policy and 'import a live project' into another policy. This migration process should work irrespective of the policy versions, standard registries, and Guardian instances, automatically mapping data/documents to the corresponding policy steps in an intelligent way, referring to the Project Developer in situations needing human input via a convenient UI/UX ('User Experience'):

* Project Developer can preview and assess the compatibility of policies and data, and the result of the migration using something analogous to the 'dry-run' mode.
* For cases where the 'new' schemas and policy steps match perfectly the 'old' valid data/documents from the 'source', the 'old' ones should be automatically accepted into the 'target' policy flow with no human intervention.
* Project Developer can review and select/guide the matching and the destination of the 'source' data/documents into the new policy flow with full visibility with regard to:
  * 'source' and 'target' policy structure (side by side), with details of block parameters etc where required.
  * content of the original and destination documents with field-level granularity
* Where data needs to be augmented and thus new signatures are required the corresponding Guardian users (e.g. Standard Registry) get requests to sign the data.

The migration process should be automated, and should result in the 'stopped' project/policy execution on the 'source platform' and 'resumed' from the same point in the policy flow on the 'destination' (other) platform, with full data and tokens visibility and provenance provability in the trust chain. The 'old' data and artifacts produced on the 'source' should be fully useable on the 'target', e.g.

* used in reports
* viewable in the UI
* data referencable and useable in calculations and other policy actions (such as minting)
* operations on 'old' tokens are supported in the new policy smart contracts (retirement, exchanges, etc)

### Full project data comparison as produced/captured by policies

Introduce a comparison functionality where it'd be possible to 'diff' arbitrary sections or the entire trust-chains for different tokens, potentially issued by different policies such that the system would:

* graphically display the differences where a user would then be able to 'scroll' through and review them in the UI
* get a numerical 'similarity score' indicating how similar the two 'chains' are

### Global environmental/Guardian data search (indexer) component for Hedera and IPFS

* Improve the data storage and indexing capabilities of Guardian for the data belonging to the local instance such that complex analytical queries could be run efficiently, such as 'search for data similar to this' and 'what is the possibility of this being a double entry for something submitted elsewhere'.
* Introduce a global search and indexing capability for data produce by other (all) instances such that queries above could be run on the entire body of Guardian data produced from the beginning of time (in blockchain sense).
* Extend [Block and policy discoverability/search #2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) for users to be able to preview the usage of the block without having to import "other SR's" policy into their Guardian instance

### Revamp Guardian user/roles and permissions model

* Fundamentally separate the concept of users, roles and permissions in Guardian
* Introduce granular concept of permissions which could be assigned to users, a user could then perform a specific function within the role if its assigned role 'contains' this permission. These should include (but not limited to):
  * Policy edit/submit for review
  * Policy view
  * Policy approval & publish
* Introduce a "user admin" role, which allows:
  * defining new roles from permissions
  * assigning of roles to users
* Create a permissioning system which verifies actor role before any action has been taken throughout Guardian
* Package in suitable most-common role set into Guardian so it can be operated immediately 'out of the box' without the need for additional configuration
* Create a concept of 'delegation' where a user with a particular role/permission can explicitly 'delegate' this role/permission to another user
* Introduce the functionality to produce a report (page, download) which lists all users and their roles/permissions mapping in the system

Relying on the work done in the course of [#1793](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1793) (i.e. creating data structures (hashes) to enable more efficient comparison), allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for local policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold. This is related (but different) to [#2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) as it focuses on 'easy diff' vs 'easy search'.
