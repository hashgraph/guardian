## ---- February 2025----

### Add policy support for more than one external data block

Allow more than one external data block per policy. Each external data block should be able to handle a different schema, enabling multiple types of data to be sent from external sources as needed.

### Firing external event when minting process is finished

* Add another external event when the minting process is completed (i.e. external-events.token\_minting\_process\_completed)
* Include in the event payload, among other details like tokenID, minted tokens, etc, the consensus timestamp of the last mint transaction

### Establish deprecation policy for architectural APIs

* Identify and enumerate all architectural APIs significant to end users
* Extend API deprecation policy coverage to include the above APIs

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1794](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1794)

### Cross-context (API+UI) refresh token invalidation (regression from v2.18.0)

Looking into the code, it seems that the refresh token should last for a year, this is fine as it is configurable, but losing login context (or a user potentially feeling they lost all their data) isn't great UX.

In terms of code behaviour, I would presume that this change would fix the issue:

```
const user = await new DataBaseHelper(User).findOne({refreshToken: decryptedToken.id, username: decryptedToken.name});
```

to

```
const user = await new DataBaseHelper(User).findOne({username: decryptedToken.name});
```

The reason why this _**might**_ be okay, is that the _expire at_ decoding happens on the line above, so a refresh token, would last for the period of time by default.

As this is authentication related, it requires review from more people.

### Business UseCase for Emissions Reduction/Removals (ERRs)Calculation Pre-Calculator in Guardian

We are in the process of creating a few approaches to this ticket from the business use case perspective. One is essentially an ‚Äúestimator‚Äù with a simplified workflow that can be used to estimate emission reductions, token issuance, etc. upfront to help the user better anticipate issuances and the impacts of various project activities and methodological choices. The other is more of a ‚Äúsummary preview‚Äù of the actual calculation results, that can be implemented just before validation (or anytime thereafter) to see summary KPIs based on the actual inputs and methodological choices made by the user, and they can then interact with the data like the Nerd Wallet retirement calculator to see how changes to the project activities could impact issuances. To be discussed further with the team.

### Add capabilities to display complex geoJSON shapes superimposed on maps

* Introduce capability for geometric shapes display for geoJSON in Guardian UI (both Indexer and Guardian itself).
* Shapes display must be correctly superimposed on maps wherever possible

## ---- March 2025----

### Weak Default configuration

Change the password to a strong, random value, or create additional setup steps were the deployer is required to set this secrets. Additionally, set the most secure configuration as the default in the repository. This ensures that any user deploying the repository will benefit from enhanced security by default. In addition, as highlighted on the issue finding "Lack of Security Hardening Guides", a security guideline is recommened so that users can configure securely their environment before deploying it.

### System Logs Accessible by All Registries

It is recommended to separate the system functionality from the registry functionality specifically for log management. Additionally, it would be appropriate to restrict access to system logs to a different admin role, who would only review the system logs. For registry logs, it is recommended to ensure that one registry can only view its logs, without seeing the logs of other registry users.

### Manual trigger of re-indexing for specific policy, SR, token

* Introduce a new capability into the indexer to trigger manual re-indexing for a specific 'vertical', starting at a specific topic and navigating (only) down the hierarchy for immediate availability of data.
* Develop a UI for users to provide a Topic ID for one of the specific items below as an entry point into the 'vertical':
  * Policy
  * Standard registry
  * Token
* When manual re-indexing is scheduled it must take priority, or the rest should gets postponed until the manually-triggered update is finished.
* The user who triggered the update must be notified when the update is finished.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4560](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4560)

## ---- April 2025----

### Accessing a Guardian policy from a Guardian instance other than the publishing instance

A Guardian user should be able to access a policy published by another Guardian instance from their own Guardian instance. This access should be based on a request-grant model.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3951](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3951)

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Request Data module

If the functionality is important enough to keep despite the risk, then all URLs should be requested through a secure proxy server. This is a significant effort, and to be secure the proxy must ensure that:

1. The URL does not resolve to a private or local IP address 2. Redirects are not followed
2. Only HTTP(S) protocol schemes are supported\
   Additionally, the application server should define and enforce rate limits to discourage abuse of the functionality as a web scanner.\
   If the application is hosted on AWS servers, enforce usage of AWS ‚ÄúInstance Metadata Service Version 2‚Äù with token usage required. This is a new AWS metadata API which severely curtails the ability of attackers to abuse SSRF to access the AWS metadata API. However, this will not prevent attacks against other internal services.

### Detailed Research on Indexer Enhancements

Identify and implement indexer enhancements based on example use cases and community feedback.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4561](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4561)

## ---- May 2025----

### Exporting Project Data in CSV format

1. We should be able to export the complete project data of any policy in CSV format through Guardian.
2. We should also be able to apply filters to the project data, which should be included in the export file.
3. When we export the data in csv format, it should follow proper naming convention such as saving the exported file by its respective policy name\_version.csv

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3680](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3680)

### Missing Authentication between Services

It is recommended to implement mutual authentication for all internal microservice communications to ensure that each service can verify the identity of the other. It is recommended to ensure that each service is properly authenticated, using authorization roles and permissions to ensure that each service can only publish or consume messages in the queues relevant to its designated function. Moreover, messages could be digitally signed, ensuring they originate from the correct service. At each step in the process, the signatures can be verified to ensure that the message has not been tampered with. Where applicable, integrate these recommendations into the security hardening guide to ensure organizations deploying the application can implement these best practices effectively.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4107](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/4107)

### Session Token in URL

The application should use an alternative mechanism for transmitting session tokens, for example, the Authorization header, as it is done by the rest of the web application.22

### Guardian policy embedded code testing/debugging facility for Custom Logic, Calculate, etc blocks

* Introduce the 'Test' button to all places where **source** or **math** code can be inputted in Guardian policy which would trigger the 'in place' execution of the code based on the execution context and defined inputs/outputs of the block. This tool could prompt the user for input data when required.
* Add ability to 'print' (i.e. log) data and variable values somewhere when test-running policy (e.g. in Dry-run mode). This way policy authors would be able to examine the data structures passed into the functions and identify unexpected behaviour in this area.
* Add recommendations to the documentation wrt running this code in an separate developer environment, i.e. all the needed execution context such as imported libraries etc so those developers who prefer to use their code editors can replicate the execution of the code there.

### No Password Policy

It is recommended to create a password policy, that can be configured by the organizations using the application. It should also be noted that recent guidance from NCSC promotes password policies which are designed to decrease the burden on the user. This can include relaxing controls requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals in favor of the use of suitably complex passwords. The NCSC password guidance21 should be reviewed to determine if this new guidance can be applied to the environment reviewed.

## ---- July 2025----

### Identifying, Implementing and Integrating 3rd Party data resources

* Identify and shortlist 2-3 key Environmental-related data sources to be used as reference data and/or
* Implement integration with these 3rd party data providers (may be similar to IPFS/Hedera integration), such as:
* policy can easily add such 'integration' to their policy - potentially using the new policy modules functionality [Linkable policy modules for constructing end-to-end Policy workflows #1657](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1657)
* the data can be defined as mandatory or optional (by the policy author)
* data imported into Policy artifacts is stored and displayed in its native format, preserving 'mime type' and/or any other indication of the nature of the data as well as the identity/credentials of the source, time/date and other identifying information as appropriate

### Authorization Headers Potentially Leaked through IPFS in Request Data Module

Implement a secure method to handle secrets in the Request Data module that ensures sensitive information, such as authorization headers, is not published with the policy. A possibility may be to include encrypted headers with the public key that only the private key of the policy owner can decrypt. Other possibility may be to store the secrets headers in the vault and fetch them at runtime using appropriate access controls. Update the documentation to explicitly warn policy creators about the risks of including sensitive information in the policies and recommend using the module only for public HTTP methods. Provide guidelines on securely configuring policies to avoid the leakage of sensitive data.

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

### Live project (data) migration across Policies, across Guardian instances

Implement User Interface (UI) and tooling allowing users to execute multiple cycles of 'export a live project' from a policy and 'import a live project' into another policy. This migration process should work irrespective of the policy versions, standard registries, and Guardian instances, automatically mapping data/documents to the corresponding policy steps in an intelligent way, referring to the Project Developer in situations needing human input via a convenient UI/UX ('User Experience'):

* Project Developer can preview and assess the compatibility of policies and data, and the result of the migration using something analogous to the 'dry-run' mode.
* For cases where the 'new' schemas and policy steps match perfectly the 'old' valid data/documents from the 'source', the 'old' ones should be automatically accepted into the 'target' policy flow with no human intervention.
* Project Developer can review and select/guide the matching and the destination of the 'source' data/documents into the new policy flow with full visibility with regard to:
  * 'source' and 'target' policy structure (side by side), with details of block parameters etc where required.
  * content of the original and destination documents with field-level granularity
* Where data needs to be augmented and thus new signatures are required the corresponding Guardian users (e.g. Standard Registry) get requests to sign the data.

The migration process should be automated, and should result in the 'stopped' project/policy execution on the 'source platform' and 'resumed' from the same point in the policy flow on the 'destination' (other) platform, with full data and tokens visibility and provenance provability in the trust chain. The 'old' data and artifacts produced on the 'source' should be fully useable on the 'target', e.g.

* used in reports
* viewable in the UI
* data referencable and useable in calculations and other policy actions (such as minting)
* operations on 'old' tokens are supported in the new policy smart contracts (retirement, exchanges, etc)

### Revamp Guardian user/roles and permissions model

* Fundamentally separate the concept of users, roles and permissions in Guardian
* Introduce granular concept of permissions which could be assigned to users, a user could then perform a specific function within the role if its assigned role 'contains' this permission. These should include (but not limited to):
  * Policy edit/submit for review
  * Policy view
  * Policy approval & publish
* Introduce a "user admin" role, which allows:
  * defining new roles from permissions
  * assigning of roles to users
* Create a permissioning system which verifies actor role before any action has been taken throughout Guardian
* Package in suitable most-common role set into Guardian so it can be operated immediately 'out of the box' without the need for additional configuration
* Create a concept of 'delegation' where a user with a particular role/permission can explicitly 'delegate' this role/permission to another user
* Introduce the functionality to produce a report (page, download) which lists all users and their roles/permissions mapping in the system

Relying on the work done in the course of [#1793](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1793) (i.e. creating data structures (hashes) to enable more efficient comparison), allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for local policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold. This is related (but different) to [#2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) as it focuses on 'easy diff' vs 'easy search'.

### Filtering data for blocks is stateful API, introduce stateless data filters for API usage

I don't necessarily think there is a hard requirement to remove the stateful nature of guardian filtering, as we cannot predict, what are the downstream API consumers are using this functionality or affects, they will be without some kind of deprecation notice.

So, the recommendation would be:

* Add ability to filter using a GET request for a filter, so data can be fetched and filtered in one action
* (As an alternative - preferred) It would be preferable to enable filtering at the block level when retrieving data so a API consumer does not need to add explicit filter blocks in block can use the Guardian API to be more RESTful by default.
* Post a six month deprecation notice for stateful usage of the filter (revert if hard requirement for others)

An example, code enhancement could be implemented like this (tags are easier to reason about):

From old version:

```
  public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
  {
      return (object) $this->httpClient->post("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks", [
          'filterValue' => $uuid
      ], true);
  }
```

to:

```
public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
{
    return (object) $this->httpClient->get("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks?filterValue={$uuid}");
}
```

Or provide/document clearly a mechanism to filter on an [interface document block](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/policies/policy-creation/introduction/interfacedocumentssourceblock) itself, which would be **preferred**.

* Ensure clear association with **the same methodology** for all TokenIDs and their respective trustchains. I.e. it should be clear that 'these tokens' have been issued by the same Policy, but for different projects.
* Extend trust chain to show multiple tokens and multiple projects 'managed' by the same policy

* Backward compatibility is not broken for 'old' clients which are unaware of the existence of API versions&#x20;
* The versioning technology selected (see options [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/versioning)) is aligned with the wishes of Guardian community&#x20;
* API versions deprecation is appropriately embedded into the Guardian Push schedule&#x20;
* Versioning numbering scheme:&#x20;
* Meaningfully reflects changes in the API from version to version&#x20;
* Is aligned with the generally accepted practice&#x20;
* Is separate from the Guardian versions&#x20;

### Default values for schema-defined fields

* Make Guardian policy engine UI to put in the default values into the fields of forms based on such schemas. The fact that these are default values automatically inserted into the field should be clearly identifiable, i.e. they need to look different from the values users explicitly put into the (other) fields.&#x20;
* All standard tools/libraries (e.g. for verification) should work with such schemas out of the box&#x20;

### Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability

1. Design and implement specialized analytics engine which would enable Guardian to identify, trace and display mathematical relations between data in different artifacts (VCs/VPs/tokens) including events (transactions/messages) on Hedera hashgraph, with unlimited traceability depth.
2. Intelligent 'understanding' of the nature of the transformations (e.g. in formulas in calculation blocks) is out of scope of this ticket, the analytics engine can view transformations as black boxes. If the 'original' data are used as 'input' into such a black box, for the purposes of this analytics reporting it can be assumed that the 'output' data depends on that 'original' data.
3. The system should correctly identify and display references to the 'original' data such as when VC document fields reference document fields in other VCs.
4. Users should be able to perform complex data searches with the scope limited to the dependencies graph.
5. Guardian UI should enable Project Developers to define (and name) new datapoints and publish these definitions in a standardized manner linking them both to the originator's author DID, project ID and policy ID.

### Scope 3/PCF Referencing Demo (Methodology Breakdown)

Once the approach has been approved, we can update the GHGP policy and run the example data, publish the PCFs to the Hedera Network, and demonstrate how another guardian policy (of a supply chain partner) can reference a dynamic PCF to support scope 3 calculations. I believe Wes was interested in having this be a methodology breakdown.

### API facilities to retrieve unique references (IDs) of results for API-triggered operations

* Design a generic approach to the 'traceability' of API calls such that for each API call a chain of events and actions within Guardian policy and especially to outside systems can be established via the unique IDs culminating in:&#x20;
* Hedera transactions&#x20;
* Hedera topics messages&#x20;
* Hedera contract calls&#x20;
* Artifacts published on IPFS&#x20;
* Introduce a corresponding UI where users can visually observe the same information&#x20;
* Consider packaging this into Interactions Resilience Module (see related [Hedera interactions resilience module #2905](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2905))

### Guardian analytics: labels and top down data way points

* Introduce 2 new workflows into Guardian, which include the corresponding roles and access permissions:
  * labels author, for users to be able to create the 'rulesets' for evaluating data for their compliance with the chosen 'label',
  * auditor workflow, for users which would use these 'rulesets' to apply to data.
* Introduce the concept of labels, which can be specified to combine multiple statistics (introduced in [Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability #3336](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3336)) to create 'higher-order' statistics which themselves can be combined further essentially enabling the creation of 'data transformation' trees which, when applied to data, would ultimately get resolved into binary compliant/non-compliant answers. The top-level 'nodes' in these trees are 'Labels'.
* Enhance the current capability of qualitative evaluations in Statistics to support the ability for users to attach external evidence and add textual comments/explanations whenever a human input is enabled. The evidence would then become part of the 'evaluation trust-chain', i.e. it should be hashed and stored verifiably. Evidence in the image formats should be viewable in the browser, archives (zip files), pdfs, csv files should be supported for attachment and then download.
* Enable Auditors to apply 'label rulesets' to tokens, Guardian would then automatically traverse the token trust-chain to find and evaluate the required data to produce the label conclusion, i.e. the compliant/non-compliant results. These results can optionally be published to IPFS/topics by Auditors that generated them.
* Enable ordinary users to search for statistics, label ruleset, and label conclusions that have been published.

### Formula Linked Definitions & Schema Tree Enhancement

1. Introduce a UI component, or 2 separate but compatible components, into the Guardian which can display mathematical formulas in a format familiar to the user (like formulas in a LaTex documents of PDFs). These formulas should be interactive, i.e.:
   * at the viewing time individual elements of the formulas should be clickable so users can drill into the variables and see corresponding schemas/documents.
   * users should be able to input formulas (in a formula editor) of sufficient complexity to cover all VCM cases
   * users should be able to copy/paste entire formulas or parts thereof
2. Enable policy authors to map schema tree structures to formulas, linking the fields and variables so Guardian UI can display them as per point above
3. Enhance Guardian schema, policy and VC/VPs views to display the formulas whenever they are available.
4. Introduce the ability to attach a PDF file to the schemas/formulas at the policy/schema creation time, and specify the (external) 'origin' link so the original source of the math can be traced to the original paper.
5. Enhance schema tree view to display the formulas alongside schemas.

### Dry-run policy execution 'savepoints' - restart policy dry-run from the list of 'saved' places

* Introduce a new functionality for users to 'save' dry-run execution status at arbitrary points by clicking 'save state' button.&#x20;
* The system should support the creation of multiple save points for the same execution workflow&#x20;
* Next time the (draft) policy is executed in the dry-run mode users should be given a choice whether to restart from the beginning or continue execution from any of the 'save points'.&#x20;
* Starting execution from a 'save point' invalidates and removes all the other save points that logically followed it&#x20;
* It should be possible to delete some or all save points manually&#x20;
