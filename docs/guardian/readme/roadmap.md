## ---- January 2025----

### Climate Action Reserve's U.S. Landfill Protocol

1. Creating Schema design for this methodology.&#x20;
2. Development of the schema and policy.&#x20;
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3709](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3709)

### Scope 3/PCF Referencing Demo (Methodology Breakdown)

Once the approach has been approved, we can update the GHGP policy and run the example data, publish the PCFs to the Hedera Network, and demonstrate how another guardian policy (of a supply chain partner) can reference a dynamic PCF to support scope 3 calculations. I believe Wes was interested in having this be a methodology breakdown.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3723](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3723)

### API facilities to retrieve unique references (IDs) of results for API-triggered operations

* Design a generic approach to the 'traceability' of API calls such that for each API call a chain of events and actions within Guardian policy and especially to outside systems can be established via the unique IDs culminating in:&#x20;
* Hedera transactions&#x20;
* Hedera topics messages&#x20;
* Hedera contract calls&#x20;
* Artifacts published on IPFS&#x20;
* Introduce a corresponding UI where users can visually observe the same information&#x20;
* Consider packaging this into Interactions Resilience Module (see related [Hedera interactions resilience module #2905](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2905))

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3139](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3139)

### Guardian analytics: labels and top down data way points

* Introduce 2 new workflows into Guardian, which include the corresponding roles and access permissions:
  * labels author, for users to be able to create the 'rulesets' for evaluating data for their compliance with the chosen 'label',
  * auditor workflow, for users which would use these 'rulesets' to apply to data.
* Introduce the concept of labels, which can be specified to combine multiple statistics (introduced in [Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability #3336](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3336)) to create 'higher-order' statistics which themselves can be combined further essentially enabling the creation of 'data transformation' trees which, when applied to data, would ultimately get resolved into binary compliant/non-compliant answers. The top-level 'nodes' in these trees are 'Labels'.
* Enhance the current capability of qualitative evaluations in Statistics to support the ability for users to attach external evidence and add textual comments/explanations whenever a human input is enabled. The evidence would then become part of the 'evaluation trust-chain', i.e. it should be hashed and stored verifiably. Evidence in the image formats should be viewable in the browser, archives (zip files), pdfs, csv files should be supported for attachment and then download.
* Enable Auditors to apply 'label rulesets' to tokens, Guardian would then automatically traverse the token trust-chain to find and evaluate the required data to produce the label conclusion, i.e. the compliant/non-compliant results. These results can optionally be published to IPFS/topics by Auditors that generated them.
* Enable ordinary users to search for statistics, label ruleset, and label conclusions that have been published.

### Trustchain support for contract-based issuance and retirement implementation

Extend/modify trustchain implementation to support new contract-based issuance and retirement functionality such that users have visibility to the entire lifecycle of the token and have access to all significant artifacts produced as a result.

## American Carbon Registry (ACR) ACR Methodology for Quantifying, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions and Removals from Landfill Gas Destruction and Beneficial Use Projects

1. Creating Schema design for this methodology.&#x20;
2. Development of the schema and policy.&#x20;
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3710](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3710)

### Reviewing and Verifying Atma policy

Some interesting next steps could be to address the final data gaps; engage with PACT to review the policy and schema, provide feedback, and identify new use cases and features; engage with a third-party auditor to review or potentially verify the policy; and eventually have actual downstream supply chain partners referencing the PCF.

### Emissions Reduction/Removals (ERRs) Calculation Pre-Calculator in Guardian

Based on input data a estimated ERRs should be able to be queried in project development.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3619](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3619)

### Formula Driven Definitions & Schema Tree Enhancement

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3408](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3408)

### Dry-run policy execution 'savepoints' - restart policy dry-run from the list of 'saved' places

* Introduce a new functionality for users to 'save' dry-run execution status at arbitrary points by clicking 'save state' button.&#x20;
* The system should support the creation of multiple save points for the same execution workflow&#x20;
* Next time the (draft) policy is executed in the dry-run mode users should be given a choice whether to restart from the beginning or continue execution from any of the 'save points'.&#x20;
* Starting execution from a 'save point' invalidates and removes all the other save points that logically followed it&#x20;
* It should be possible to delete some or all save points manually&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2838](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2838)

### Standardize UI on Angular Material, remove/replace PrimeNG

* Standardize Guardian UI to be Material-based&#x20;
* Remove/Replace all PrimeNG with Material without changing the look feel&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3141](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3141)

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

## ---- February 2024----

### Support externally controlled DIDs with keys in Guardian

Introduce a workflow into the Guardian where a DID Controller would introduce a dedicated verification method into the main DID for which the private key would be stored and managed by a Guardian instance. This way Guardian would only be able to control the specific verification method's key, but not the rest of the DID.

### Mitigation Credits Research

Introduce the ability to mint Mitigation Asset Type tokens as the result of the calculation of the diff between planned (and reported on the Environmental) and actual results of the calculations based on the MRV data for a reporting period. This would likely require:

* New type of blocks in the policy definition language specifying 'target' numbers.
* Policy Engine ability to mint different types of tokens depending on the conditions
* Needs to be linked with [GHG scorecards Research #1017](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1017) logic

### Live project (data) migration across Policies, across Guardian instances

Implement User Interface (UI) and tooling allowing users to execute multiple cycles of 'export a live project' from a policy and 'import a live project' into another policy. This migration process should work irrespective of the policy versions, standard registries, and Guardian instances, automatically mapping data/documents to the corresponding policy steps in an intelligent way, referring to the Project Developer in situations needing human input via a convenient UI/UX ('User Experience'):

* Project Developer can preview and assess the compatibility of policies and data, and the result of the migration using something analogous to the 'dry-run' mode.
* For cases where the 'new' schemas and policy steps match perfectly the 'old' valid data/documents from the 'source', the 'old' ones should be automatically accepted into the 'target' policy flow with no human intervention.
* Project Developer can review and select/guide the matching and the destination of the 'source' data/documents into the new policy flow with full visibility with regard to:
  * 'source' and 'target' policy structure (side by side), with details of block parameters etc where required.
  * content of the original and destination documents with field-level granularity
* Where data needs to be augmented and thus new signatures are required the corresponding Guardian users (e.g. Standard Registry) get requests to sign the data.

The migration process should be automated, and should result in the 'stopped' project/policy execution on the 'source platform' and 'resumed' from the same point in the policy flow on the 'destination' (other) platform, with full data and tokens visibility and provenance provability in the trust chain. The 'old' data and artifacts produced on the 'source' should be fully useable on the 'target', e.g.

* used in reports
* viewable in the UI
* data referencable and useable in calculations and other policy actions (such as minting)
* operations on 'old' tokens are supported in the new policy smart contracts (retirement, exchanges, etc)

### Full project data comparison as produced/captured by policies

Introduce a comparison functionality where it'd be possible to 'diff' arbitrary sections or the entire trust-chains for different tokens, potentially issued by different policies such that the system would:

* graphically display the differences where a user would then be able to 'scroll' through and review them in the UI
* get a numerical 'similarity score' indicating how similar the two 'chains' are

### Revamp Guardian user/roles and permissions model

* Fundamentally separate the concept of users, roles and permissions in Guardian
* Introduce granular concept of permissions which could be assigned to users, a user could then perform a specific function within the role if its assigned role 'contains' this permission. These should include (but not limited to):
  * Policy edit/submit for review
  * Policy view
  * Policy approval & publish
* Introduce a "user admin" role, which allows:
  * defining new roles from permissions
  * assigning of roles to users
* Create a permissioning system which verifies actor role before any action has been taken throughout Guardian
* Package in suitable most-common role set into Guardian so it can be operated immediately 'out of the box' without the need for additional configuration
* Create a concept of 'delegation' where a user with a particular role/permission can explicitly 'delegate' this role/permission to another user
* Introduce the functionality to produce a report (page, download) which lists all users and their roles/permissions mapping in the system

### Further evolution of policy comparison (a.k.a 'mass diff')

Relying on the work done in the course of [#1793](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1793) (i.e. creating data structures (hashes) to enable more efficient comparison), allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for local policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold. This is related (but different) to [#2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) as it focuses on 'easy diff' vs 'easy search'.

### Filtering data for blocks is stateful API, introduce stateless data filters for API usage

I don't necessarily think there is a hard requirement to remove the stateful nature of guardian filtering, as we cannot predict, what are the downstream API consumers are using this functionality or affects, they will be without some kind of deprecation notice.

So, the recommendation would be:

* Add ability to filter using a GET request for a filter, so data can be fetched and filtered in one action
* (As an alternative - preferred) It would be preferable to enable filtering at the block level when retrieving data so a API consumer does not need to add explicit filter blocks in block can use the Guardian API to be more RESTful by default.
* Post a six month deprecation notice for stateful usage of the filter (revert if hard requirement for others)

An example, code enhancement could be implemented like this (tags are easier to reason about):

From old version:

```
  public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
  {
      return (object) $this->httpClient->post("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks", [
          'filterValue' => $uuid
      ], true);
  }
```

to:

```
public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
{
    return (object) $this->httpClient->get("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks?filterValue={$uuid}");
}
```

Or provide/document clearly a mechanism to filter on an [interface document block](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/policies/policy-creation/introduction/interfacedocumentssourceblock) itself, which would be **preferred**.

* The versioning technology selected (see options [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/versioning)) is aligned with the wishes of Guardian community&#x20;
* API versions deprecation is appropriately embedded into the Guardian Push schedule&#x20;
* Versioning numbering scheme:&#x20;
* Meaningfully reflects changes in the API from version to version&#x20;
* Is aligned with the generally accepted practice&#x20;

* Make Guardian policy engine UI to put in the default values into the fields of forms based on such schemas. The fact that these are default values automatically inserted into the field should be clearly identifiable, i.e. they need to look different from the values users explicitly put into the (other) fields.&#x20;
* All standard tools/libraries (e.g. for verification) should work with such schemas out of the box&#x20;

### Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability

1. Design and implement specialized analytics engine which would enable Guardian to identify, trace and display mathematical relations between data in different artifacts (VCs/VPs/tokens) including events (transactions/messages) on Hedera hashgraph, with unlimited traceability depth.
2. Intelligent 'understanding' of the nature of the transformations (e.g. in formulas in calculation blocks) is out of scope of this ticket, the analytics engine can view transformations as black boxes. If the 'original' data are used as 'input' into such a black box, for the purposes of this analytics reporting it can be assumed that the 'output' data depends on that 'original' data.
3. The system should correctly identify and display references to the 'original' data such as when VC document fields reference document fields in other VCs.
4. Users should be able to perform complex data searches with the scope limited to the dependencies graph.
5. Guardian UI should enable Project Developers to define (and name) new datapoints and publish these definitions in a standardized manner linking them both to the originator's author DID, project ID and policy ID.

### Rationalize API and UI return error codes

Let‚Äôs say I submit incorrect data to a block (as I would like to rely on the schema validation on the guardian) \
Looking at the logs, I received an error about JSON schema validation:&#x20;

```
2023-11-22 17:00:39 hedera-guardian-guardian-service-1 | 2023-11-22T17:00:39.765Z [GUARDIAN_SERVICE]: Error: Error: {"type":"JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR","details":[{"instancePath":"","schemaPath":"#/required","keyword":"required","params":{"missingProperty":"field4"},"message":"must have required property 'field4'"}]} 
```

I am receiving a 500 status code back from a block submission in point where I would normally expect to receive something kin to a 422 (unprocessable entity)?&#x20;
