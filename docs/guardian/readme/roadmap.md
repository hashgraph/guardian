### Indexer API

Add suitable API facilities which would allow programmatic access to the indexed data and analytics, which include policy structure data (such as formulas used in the various elements - e.g. Tools) as well as project data.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3637](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3637)

### Filtering data for blocks is stateful API, introduce stateless data filters for API usage

I don't necessarily think there is a hard requirement to remove the stateful nature of guardian filtering, as we cannot predict, what are the downstream API consumers are using this functionality or affects, they will be without some kind of deprecation notice.

So, the recommendation would be:

* Add ability to filter using a GET request for a filter, so data can be fetched and filtered in one action
* (As an alternative - preferred) It would be preferable to enable filtering at the block level when retrieving data so a API consumer does not need to add explicit filter blocks in block can use the Guardian API to be more RESTful by default.
* Post a six month deprecation notice for stateful usage of the filter (revert if hard requirement for others)

An example, code enhancement could be implemented like this (tags are easier to reason about):

From old version:

```
  public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
  {
      return (object) $this->httpClient->post("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks", [
          'filterValue' => $uuid
      ], true);
  }
```

to:

```
public function filterByTag(string $policyId, string $tag, string $uuid): object
{
    return (object) $this->httpClient->get("policies/{$policyId}/tag/{$tag}/blocks?filterValue={$uuid}");
}
```

Or provide/document clearly a mechanism to filter on an [interface document block](https://docs.hedera.com/guardian/guardian/standard-registry/policies/policy-creation/introduction/interfacedocumentssourceblock) itself, which would be **preferred**.

### Auto-testing community submitted policies

* Relying on the [Policy equivalence assessment based on their execution results for the same data #1886](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1886) and [Full project data comparison as produced/captured by policies #2704](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2704) introduce capability to automatically and repeatably test policies
* Introduce a hook into the new policy merge and release build events which triggers execution of the community policies regression test cycle

## ---- August 2024----

### Token action block to work with token templates

Enhance token action block to work with token templates in the same way as it works with pre-defined tokens.

### Enhance MongoDB Integration by incorporating seamless support for popular third-party services, such as MongoDB Atlas.

The task at hand involves modifying the codebase to seamlessly integrate the new MongoDB Atlas connection string without the redundant mongodb:// prefix. The correct format for the DB\_HOST environment variable should be mongodb+srv://:@staging.wj9lvfj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true\&w=majority. This adjustment will ensure a successful and accurate connection to our MongoDB Atlas instance.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2940](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2940)

### Default values for schema-defined fields

* Introduce facilities into the Guardian schema language which would allow Guardian policy engine (and humans when they read these schemas in json) to recognize what values should be considered default for the documents based on these schemas.&#x20;
* Make Guardian policy engine UI to put in the default values into the fields of forms based on such schemas. The fact that these are default values automatically inserted into the field should be clearly identifiable, i.e. they need to look different from the values users explicitly put into the (other) fields.&#x20;
* All standard tools/libraries (e.g. for verification) should work with such schemas out of the box&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2942](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2942)

### API versioning and support/deprecation schedule

Introduce versioning of Guardian API such that:&#x20;

* Backward compatibility is not broken for 'old' clients which are unaware of the existence of API versions&#x20;
* The versioning technology selected (see options [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/versioning)) is aligned with the wishes of Guardian community&#x20;
* API versions deprecation is appropriately embedded into the Guardian Push schedule&#x20;
* Versioning numbering scheme:&#x20;
* Meaningfully reflects changes in the API from version to version&#x20;
* Is aligned with the generally accepted practice&#x20;
* Is separate from the Guardian versions&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3236](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3236)

### Leverage the pre-built images as the default way to start Guardian locally

* Update docker-compose.yml to leverage pre-built images from the latest Push&#x20;
* Create a docker-compose-build.yml with the same content as the current docker-compose.yml file to allow developers to build images locally via docker&#x20;
* Update the docs accordingly&#x20;

## ---- September 2024----

### Guardian analytics: insights and top-down data way points

The overall goal is to create a tool which provides non-technical high-level users (banks, auditors, analysts, accountants, etc) with insights out the box, and can serve as a way point for further data analytics, discovery and diagnostics.&#x20;

* Introduce an AI data analytics backend which automatically and continuously processes and analyses Guardian data across the entire ecosystem with the purpose of identifying patterns, dependencies, trends, important factors and variables, groups (cohorts) of data, etc.&#x20;
* Develop an analytics UI and visualization tool which is useable by non-technical users. This UI should allow users to continuously 'zoom in' or 'shift horizontally' on the data or the analytics results to examine them on a more detailed level or for a different parameter set: a different location, industry, sector, time range, specific values etc.&#x20;
* Implement functionality to visualize and search the structure (or organization) of Guardian data, which allows users to determine for example which schemas refer to attributes, in which policies they are used, and then seamlessly navigate to which data has been generated that's connected to these.&#x20;
* Provide an intelligent search interface which allows users at any point, while looking at a selection of data or an analytics result, to search for a 'similar' data or analytics result, while parameterizing the search with additional criteria. E.g. 'find similar set of MRVs but from projects in West Africa and those produced between 2021 and 2023'.&#x20;
* Allow users to save the configuration of their searches, UI settings/configurations and other parameters generating analytics results, etc so users can repeat and further enhance their previous analysis later - with newly available data.&#x20;

### Rationalize API and UI return error codes

Let‚Äôs say I submit incorrect data to a block (as I would like to rely on the schema validation on the guardian) \
Looking at the logs, I received an error about JSON schema validation:&#x20;

```
2023-11-22 17:00:39 hedera-guardian-guardian-service-1 | 2023-11-22T17:00:39.765Z [GUARDIAN_SERVICE]: Error: Error: {"type":"JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR","details":[{"instancePath":"","schemaPath":"#/required","keyword":"required","params":{"missingProperty":"field4"},"message":"must have required property 'field4'"}]} 
```

I am receiving a 500 status code back from a block submission in point where I would normally expect to receive something kin to a 422 (unprocessable entity)?&#x20;

### Simplify default SR schema to take out optional properties

Remove ISIC, geography, law 'required' fields so to simplify the creation of the SRs.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3435 ](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3435)

### On-demand state proof generation for critical Guardian operations

* Introduce the ability to trigger [Hedera State Proof ](https://hedera.com/blog/state-proofs-on-hedera)generation from Guardian interface for actions/operations or the general status of the Policy.&#x20;
* State proofs are to be generated and presented to users for download. Guardian will not keep any registry or store them on the system.&#x20;
* Introduce UI and the backend functionality to verify Hedera State Proofs generated by Guardian, ensure the long-term compatibility of this functionality.&#x20;

### Verra SDVM001 SD Vista Methodology for Time Savings from Improved Cookstoves

1. Creating Schema design for this methodology.&#x20;
2. Development of the schema and policy.&#x20;
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.&#x20;

### Scope 3/PCF Referencing Demo (Methodology Breakdown)

Once the approach has been approved, we can update the GHGP policy and run the example data, publish the PCFs to the Hedera Network, and demonstrate how another guardian policy (of a supply chain partner) can reference a dynamic PCF to support scope 3 calculations. I believe Wes was interested in having this be a methodology breakdown.

## ---- October 2024----

### Block configuration (mini-) wizards

Recent improvement in [#1655](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1655) and [#1687](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1687) introduced high-level wizards for Policy creation. Similar approach can be taken for configuring individual blocks - wizards can guide users via the flow and provide contextual description/documentation of UI items to avoid referring to the official documentation for user convenience:&#x20;

* implement (mini-) wizards for block configuration&#x20;
* ensure there is a brief description of each step to guide user understanding of actions&#x20;
* allow users to save and exit wizards at any time&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2235](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2235)

### API facilities to retrieve unique references (IDs) of results for API-triggered operations

* Design a generic approach to the 'traceability' of API calls such that for each API call a chain of events and actions within Guardian policy and especially to outside systems can be established via the unique IDs culminating in:&#x20;
* Hedera transactions&#x20;
* Hedera topics messages&#x20;
* Hedera contract calls&#x20;
* Artifacts published on IPFS&#x20;
* Introduce a corresponding UI where users can visually observe the same information&#x20;
* Consider packaging this into Interactions Resilience Module (see related [Hedera interactions resilience module #2905](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2905))

2. Development of the schema and policy.&#x20;
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3707](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3707)

## ---- November 2024----

### Guardian analytics: bottom-up data traceability

1. Design and implement specialized analytics engine which would enable Guardian to identify, trace and display relations between data in different artifacts (VCs/VPs/tokens) including events (transactions/messages) on Hedera hashgraph, with unlimited traceability depth.&#x20;
2. Intelligent 'understanding' of the nature of the transformations (e.g. in formulas in calculation blocks) is out of scope of this ticket, the analytics engine can view transformations as black boxes. If the 'original' data are used as 'input' into such a black box, for this analytics reporting, it can be assumed that the 'output' data depends on that data.&#x20;
3. The system should correctly identify and display references to the 'original' data such as when VC document fields reference document fields in other VCs.&#x20;
4. Users should be able to perform complex data searches with the scope limited to the dependencies graph.&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3336](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3336)

### CDM AMS-III.BM Methodology for Lightweight Two and Three Wheeled Personal Transportation

## ---- December 2024----

### Trustchain support for contract-based issuance and retirement implementation

Extend/modify trustchain implementation to support new contract-based issuance and retirement functionality such that users have visibility to the entire lifecycle of the token and have access to all significant artifacts produced as a result.

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2243](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2243)

### GS Methodology for Collection of Sargassum and Other Macroalgae to Avoid Emissions from Decomposition and to Use for Beneficial Products

1. Creating Schema design for this methodology.&#x20;
2. Development of the schema and policy.&#x20;
3. Testing the policy development through Guardian UI and configurator.&#x20;

Referral Link: [https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3710](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/3710)

### Reviewing and Verifying Atma policy

Some interesting next steps could be to address the final data gaps; engage with PACT to review the policy and schema, provide feedback, and identify new use cases and features; engage with a third-party auditor to review or potentially verify the policy; and eventually have actual downstream supply chain partners referencing the PCF.

### Dry-run policy execution 'savepoints' - restart policy dry-run from the list of 'saved' places

* Introduce a new functionality for users to 'save' dry-run execution status at arbitrary points by clicking 'save state' button.&#x20;
* The system should support the creation of multiple save points for the same execution workflow&#x20;
* Next time the (draft) policy is executed in the dry-run mode users should be given a choice whether to restart from the beginning or continue execution from any of the 'save points'.&#x20;
* Starting execution from a 'save point' invalidates and removes all the other save points that logically followed it&#x20;
* It should be possible to delete some or all save points manually&#x20;

### Implement discontinuing policy workflow

Implement the policy deprecation workflow which includes:

* Guardian UI allowing issuing SR to discontinue a policy (version) or the entire policy from a certain date (in the future or 'now').
* Policy grid should display a suitable marker against non-active policies, and a different for the ones soon expiring.
* An appropriate message posted in the corresponding Hedera topic recording the 'discontinuing' decision
* For in-progress projects that have been registered and are operating under the policy it should be possible to 'switch' to the appropriate version of the policy which is still valid.

## ---- February 2024----

### Support externally controlled DIDs with keys in Guardian

Introduce a workflow into the Guardian where a DID Controller would introduce a dedicated verification method into the main DID for which the private key would be stored and managed by a Guardian instance. This way Guardian would only be able to control the specific verification method's key, but not the rest of the DID.

### Live project (data) migration across Policies, across Guardian instances

Implement User Interface (UI) and tooling allowing users to execute multiple cycles of 'export a live project' from a policy and 'import a live project' into another policy. This migration process should work irrespective of the policy versions, standard registries, and Guardian instances, automatically mapping data/documents to the corresponding policy steps in an intelligent way, referring to the Project Developer in situations needing human input via a convenient UI/UX ('User Experience'):

* Project Developer can preview and assess the compatibility of policies and data, and the result of the migration using something analogous to the 'dry-run' mode.
* For cases where the 'new' schemas and policy steps match perfectly the 'old' valid data/documents from the 'source', the 'old' ones should be automatically accepted into the 'target' policy flow with no human intervention.
* Project Developer can review and select/guide the matching and the destination of the 'source' data/documents into the new policy flow with full visibility with regard to:
  * 'source' and 'target' policy structure (side by side), with details of block parameters etc where required.
  * content of the original and destination documents with field-level granularity
* Where data needs to be augmented and thus new signatures are required the corresponding Guardian users (e.g. Standard Registry) get requests to sign the data.

The migration process should be automated, and should result in the 'stopped' project/policy execution on the 'source platform' and 'resumed' from the same point in the policy flow on the 'destination' (other) platform, with full data and tokens visibility and provenance provability in the trust chain. The 'old' data and artifacts produced on the 'source' should be fully useable on the 'target', e.g.

* used in reports
* viewable in the UI
* data referencable and useable in calculations and other policy actions (such as minting)
* operations on 'old' tokens are supported in the new policy smart contracts (retirement, exchanges, etc)

### Full project data comparison as produced/captured by policies

Introduce a comparison functionality where it'd be possible to 'diff' arbitrary sections or the entire trust-chains for different tokens, potentially issued by different policies such that the system would:

* graphically display the differences where a user would then be able to 'scroll' through and review them in the UI
* get a numerical 'similarity score' indicating how similar the two 'chains' are

### Global environmental/Guardian data search (indexer) component for Hedera and IPFS

* Improve the data storage and indexing capabilities of Guardian for the data belonging to the local instance such that complex analytical queries could be run efficiently, such as 'search for data similar to this' and 'what is the possibility of this being a double entry for something submitted elsewhere'.
* Introduce a global search and indexing capability for data produce by other (all) instances such that queries above could be run on the entire body of Guardian data produced from the beginning of time (in blockchain sense).
* Extend [Block and policy discoverability/search #2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) for users to be able to preview the usage of the block without having to import "other SR's" policy into their Guardian instance

### Revamp Guardian user/roles and permissions model

* Fundamentally separate the concept of users, roles and permissions in Guardian
* Introduce granular concept of permissions which could be assigned to users, a user could then perform a specific function within the role if its assigned role 'contains' this permission. These should include (but not limited to):
  * Policy edit/submit for review
  * Policy view
  * Policy approval & publish
* Introduce a "user admin" role, which allows:
  * defining new roles from permissions
  * assigning of roles to users
* Create a permissioning system which verifies actor role before any action has been taken throughout Guardian
* Package in suitable most-common role set into Guardian so it can be operated immediately 'out of the box' without the need for additional configuration
* Create a concept of 'delegation' where a user with a particular role/permission can explicitly 'delegate' this role/permission to another user
* Introduce the functionality to produce a report (page, download) which lists all users and their roles/permissions mapping in the system

### Further evolution of policy comparison (a.k.a 'mass diff')

Relying on the work done in the course of [#1793](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/1793) (i.e. creating data structures (hashes) to enable more efficient comparison), allow for mass-comparison of policies such that a user should be able to search for local policies 'similar' to 'different' to some other policy based on some similarity threshold. This is related (but different) to [#2281](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/issues/2281) as it focuses on 'easy diff' vs 'easy search'.
