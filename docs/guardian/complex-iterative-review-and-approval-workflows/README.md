# Complex iterative review and approval workflows

The Complex Iterative Workflow is a digital process within Guardian that enables project developers (proponents) and validators (VVBs) to efficiently perform multiple rounds of feedback, clarifications, and document corrections during validation. Instead of lengthy, fragmented exchanges via email or offline documents, every step is captured, versioned, and discussable inside the Guardian environment, providing a full audit trail and transparency at each stage of project review and approval.

### Multi-Stage, Multi-Role Feedback Loops

* **Field-Level Commenting**: Validators can annotate any field in the project document, identifying precisely what requires clarification, correction, or further detail.
* **Targeted Discussions**: Each comment generates a discussion thread linked to a specific document section, so issues remain contextualized and easily trackable.
* **Privacy Controls**: Each thread can be made public (visible to all roles), restricted to certain roles (e.g., only Validator and Registry), or assigned to specific users, ensuring sensitive topics remain confidential where necessary.​
* **Role-Based Progression**: Only designated roles can advance the workflow to the next step, ensuring authorized actors are responsible for decision-making at each validation point.

### Iterative Updates and Resubmissions

* **Dynamic Correction Cycle**: Following a validator's comment, the project developer addresses the issue directly within the Guardian interface, updating specific fields and notifying reviewers of changes.
* **Repeatable Validation**: This loop (comment, correction, re-validation) continues as many times as necessary, until all outstanding questions are resolved and the project can be approved or validated.​
* **Structured Statuses**: The platform automatically updates project status (e.g., Waiting for Clarification, Under Review, Ready for Validation) to reflect the state of each iterative loop.

### Complete Audit Trail and Digital Verifiability

* **Traceable Communication**: All comments, changes, and resolutions are timestamped and linked to both user identity and document version.
* **Transparent Accountability**: At any stage, stakeholders can review the entire back-and-forth – from initial submission through every cycle of clarification, correction, and approval – directly in Guardian.
