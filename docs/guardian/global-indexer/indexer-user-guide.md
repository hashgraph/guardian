## 1. Step By Step Process

Indexer provides a global search facility on the landing page, and other pages‚Äô headers. It allows users to find information by matching string values.&#x20;

For example ‚ÄòProject Description‚Äô will find all entities which include ‚ÄòProject‚Äô word or ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô word.&#x20;

To find an exact phrase you need to use double quotes, e.g. type something like ‚Äò‚ÄúProject Description‚Äù‚Äô. Words can be excluded by typing ‚Äò-‚Äô symbol in the request. All searched entities have metadata in Hedera messages, search looks at policy message IDs, schema names, schema message IDs, VC/VP document content/values, schema properties, schema field names, etc‚Ä¶

To launch the Indexer, please run the following command in the root of the folder:

```
docker compose -f "docker-compose-indexer.yml" up -d --build
```

### **Launching Indexer**

Once the above command is successfully executed and all the docker containers are running, Indexer can be launched at [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005)

Sections have specific grids for displaying data and filters:

*   Accounts:

    * Standard Registries
    * Registry Users


*   Methodologies:

    * Policies
    * Tools
    * Modules
    * Schemas
    * Tokens
    * Roles


*   Documents:

    * DIDs
    * VCs
    * VPs


* Others:

Example of the grid displaying data is seen on the screenshot below:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2 (18).png>)

Majority of the grids provide capability to search by keyword filter, which has some differences in comparison to global search. In the search failed it uses ‚Äòchips‚Äô, i.e. type and press ENTER to add values, to search for specified items based on an AND condition.&#x20;

For example, searching for. schema by typing ‚ÄòProject‚Äô and ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô will find all schemas which contain ‚ÄòProject‚Äô and ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô strings.

### 1.1 Handling Local Node Files:

For documents (VC, VP, DID, Schema) with local CIDs (i.e. Such documents were uploaded onto local IPFS nodes) Guardian attempts to automatically download the file when user attempts to open in in the Indexer UI. This may not be possible if the local node is ‚Äòclosed‚Äô for outside requests. For such cases there is also an option for the user to manually attempt to download from the local IPFS node. This can be retried unlimited number of times, for situations when local node administrators open access to the node\[s] at a later date.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This functionality requires the correct setting for the IPFS\_GATEWAY configuration option in the `indexer-service .env` file:

**For example:** `IPFS_GATEWAY="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${cid}"`
