## 1. Step By Step Process

Indexer provides a global search facility on the landing page, and other pages‚Äô headers. It allows users to find information by matching string values.&#x20;

For example ‚ÄòProject Description‚Äô will find all entities which include ‚ÄòProject‚Äô word or ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô word.&#x20;

To find an exact phrase you need to use double quotes, e.g. type something like ‚Äò‚ÄúProject Description‚Äù‚Äô. Words can be excluded by typing ‚Äò-‚Äô symbol in the request. All searched entities have metadata in Hedera messages, search looks at policy message IDs, schema names, schema message IDs, VC/VP document content/values, schema properties, schema field names, etc‚Ä¶

### Landing page includes following information:

* _Registries_, _Methodologies_, _Total Documents_, _Total Issuance_. All cards are clickable. Also there is an ability to check charts with count and date.

Majority of the grids provide capability to search by keyword filter, which has some differences in comparison to global search. In the search failed it uses ‚Äòchips‚Äô, i.e. type and press ENTER to add values, to search for specified items based on an AND condition.&#x20;

For example, searching for. schema by typing ‚ÄòProject‚Äô and ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô will find all schemas which contain ‚ÄòProject‚Äô and ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô strings.
