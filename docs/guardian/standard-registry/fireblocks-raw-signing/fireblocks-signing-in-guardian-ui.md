# Fireblocks signing in Guardian UI

## **Note: Currently, FireBlocks will not work as** Hedera (HBAR\_TEST) support is broken in FireBlocks**. We are working with FireBlocks team (**[**Support Ticket**](https://community.fireblocks.com/t/failed-to-add-asset-wallet-for-hbar-test-all-others-work/936)**) to fix it asap. W**e'll provide an ETA when fixed.

1\. Enabling Fireblocks Remote Signing:

When creating a user, select the “**Use fireblocks signing**” option and populate the following fields with values from your Fireblocks account configuration:

* Fireblocks Vault ID
* Fireblocks Asset ID
* Fireblocks API Key
* Fireblocks Private Key

Users, which have been created with this option enabled to remotely sign their Hedera transactions using Fireblocks API instead of via the built-in Guardian signing workflow.
