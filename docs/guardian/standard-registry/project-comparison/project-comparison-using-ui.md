## 1. Step By Step Process

## Project Schemas

Project Schemas are predefined templates used to create VC documents. These schemas are selected for a specific policy and serve as the structural basis for generating project data.

In the current schema setup, specific â€˜property fieldsâ€™ are explicitly designated for the comparison process. These fields play a crucial role in evaluating and contrasting different projects.

These property fields were incorporated into the database as part of migration v.2-17-0, utilizing the 'policy-properties.csv' file. This integration ensures that the comparison process is seamless and data-driven.

## Project Overview

This section includes both category and policy filters, allowing users to sift through projects based on specific criteria.

### Filter Logic

Within a single group, filters apply a logical 'OR' to search for relevant projects. Between different groups, a logical 'AND' is used. This dual logic ensures a comprehensive filtering process.

### Search Enhancement

The functionality is further expanded by enabling searches based on project titles.

### Result Dashboard

Users are presented with a dashboard showcasing projects that align with their chosen filters.

### Project Selection for Comparison

Users can select multiple projects for a side-by-side comparison by clicking the 'plus' button. After selection, accessing the 'open the comparison' button redirects them to a detailed comparison view.

### Projects Comparison Page

On this page, users will find a comparative table displaying selected project fields. This visual representation allows for an easy and intuitive comparison of different projects, highlighting similarities and differences.

### VP Document Comparison

Document comparison includes examination of the VP documents generated by both projects. This works in the same way as comparing documents from the UI.
