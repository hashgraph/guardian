# 📁 Discontinuing Policy Workflow

Published policies cannot be considered as valid (active) indefinitely, there can be circumstances when existing versions of policies need to be superseded by their new versions. Such situations are considered to be policy 'deprecation' events. ‘Discontinuing workflow’ is a sequence of actions in Guardian UI which enables Standard Registry to explicitly state that a particular policy should no longer be considered active by the ecosystem and Guardian users.
