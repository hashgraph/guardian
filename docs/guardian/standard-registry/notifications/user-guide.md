1. Policy definitions can now use new Notification block. Users can configure the message, title and type (ERROR, SUCCESS, INFO, WARN), link notification to policy (policy will be opened by clicking on notification), and User (ALL,CURRENT,POLICY\_OWNER,DOCUMENT\_OWNER,DOCUMENT\_ISSUER,GROUP\_OWNER,ROLE). If User == “ROLE”, users can setup appropriate role and also mark it as “Only for current user group”
