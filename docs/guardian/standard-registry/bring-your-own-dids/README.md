# ðŸ”‘ Bring your own DIDs

At the new user registration stage, Guardian allows to â€˜bring your own DIDâ€™ (BYO DID) - externally-controlled DID - into the system instead of generating a new DID with Guardian. With BYO DID users will not be required to register the main DID private key with the Guardian instance. These users would be able to select one of the verification methods registered in their DID to be used for the signing of the VC/VP documents linked to their identity.
