# üìÅ Live Project Data Migration

Live project data migration allows seamless transitions of project data across different policies, versions, registries, and Guardian instances. This process involves the following key aspects:

1. **Automated Migration**: Users can export live project data from one policy and import it into another, regardless of policy versions or instances. This automation includes intelligent mapping of data/documents to the corresponding policy steps.
2. **User Interface and Experience**: The system provides a UI that allows project developers to preview and assess the compatibility of policies and data, similar to a 'dry-run' mode. If new schemas and policy steps match the old data perfectly, the migration happens automatically without human intervention.
3. **Manual Oversight**: For more complex migrations, the UI allows developers to review and guide the matching process, offering full visibility of the source and target policy structures and document contents.
4. **Data Provenance and Integrity**: The migration process maintains data visibility and provenance within the trust chain, ensuring that old data and artifacts are usable on the new platform for reporting, calculations, and other policy actions.

These features aim to provide a seamless, automated, and user-friendly migration experience, ensuring data integrity and continuity across different Guardian instances and policy versions‚Äã
