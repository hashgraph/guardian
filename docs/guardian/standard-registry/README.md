# Standard Registry

The Standard Registry (SR) is an accredited authority responsible for creating, managing, and publishing standards, methodologies, and policies on the Guardian platform. It serves as the trusted entity that defines how sustainability-related digital assets (like carbon credits, renewable energy certificates, or other ESG tokens) are structured, verified, and issued.

**Key Functions of the Standard Registry**

1. **Methodology Management**
   * Develops and registers new methodologies for environmental or sustainability processes (e.g., carbon reduction, reforestation, renewable energy tracking).
   * Ensures methodologies align with global compliance frameworks and best practices.
2. **Policy Creation & Governance**
   * Publishes policies that define the rules and workflows for issuing and verifying Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs).
   * Establishes how data flows between participants (project developers, auditors, validators, and buyers).
3. **Certification Authority**
   * Issues schemas, policies, and credentials that other participants must follow.
   * Provides official recognition and assurance of trust in methodologies.
4. **Ecosystem Enablement**
   * Onboards project developers, auditors, and participants to operate within its defined policies.
   * Ensures transparency, traceability, and standardization across environmental markets.
