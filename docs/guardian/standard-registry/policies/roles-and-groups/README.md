# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Roles and Groups

In Guardian, the concept of "Roles and Groups" plays a pivotal role in managing user access and permissions across different operations within the platform. This segmentation is designed to ensure that users have access only to the functionalities necessary for their role, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.&#x20;

### Roles and User Activities&#x20;

Roles within Guardian are predefined sets of permissions that determine what actions a user can perform and what parts of the system they can access. These roles are crucial for partitioning user activities and tailoring the user experience to meet the needs of specific operational functions within an organization's sustainability initiatives.&#x20;

For instance, roles are utilized in the creation and management of policies, where different user groups are given specific responsibilities. An example of this is the differentiation between users who can submit documents for approval and those who have the authority to approve or reject these documents. This distinction ensures that the process of document verification and validation is streamlined and secure.&#x20;

Another critical use of roles is in the context of token operations, where users are assigned specific roles related to the creation, management, and distribution of digital tokens. These tokens often represent environmental credits or assets, and their management is subject to strict regulatory and organizational guidelines.&#x20;

### User Groups&#x20;

User groups within Guardian are collections of users who share a common role or set of permissions. This grouping mechanism allows for easier management of access rights and simplifies the process of assigning and revoking permissions. By categorizing users into groups, administrators can efficiently implement changes across a broad set of users, ensuring that everyone within a group has the appropriate level of access to the system's functionalities.&#x20;

The segregation of users into distinct roles and groups is a testament to Guardian's commitment to providing a secure, customizable, and efficient environment for managing digital environmental assets. By carefully defining and managing roles and groups, Guardian enables organizations to optimize their sustainability efforts, ensuring that each user has the tools and permissions necessary to contribute effectively to their environmental goals.&#x20;

In conclusion, the "Roles and Groups" framework within Guardian is a foundational element that supports the platform's ability to offer tailored access and permissions. This ensures that users can efficiently and securely participate in the creation, management, and verification of digital environmental assets, all while adhering to the organization's specific operational requirements and sustainability objectives.&#x20;
