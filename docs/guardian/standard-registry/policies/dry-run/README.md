# üìÅ Dry Run

Dry Run mode refers to a feature that allows users to simulate the execution of policies or workflows without actually applying any changes or triggering actions in the live environment. It enables users to test and evaluate the behavior and outcomes of policies or workflows in a controlled manner before implementing them in a production environment.

This offers a safe and controlled environment for testing, validation, and optimization of policies or workflows. It enables users to assess the behavior and outcomes of policies without affecting live data or systems. By utilizing the dry run mode, users can enhance the reliability, accuracy, and performance of policies or workflows within the Guardian system.
