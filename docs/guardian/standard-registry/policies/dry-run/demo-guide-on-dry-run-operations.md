## 1. Step By Step Process

In this mode of operation all artifacts (files, documents and transactions) that are produced in the course of execution of the policy are stored in the local database but not sent out to Hedera or IPFS. The artifacts are stored in the database in a separate table specific for the â€˜dry runâ€™ mode. This also allows the trial for executing the workflow without real accounts.

There are different ways to start the Dry Run Mode after importing Policy.

#### 1.1 From the Policies Page

When the Policy is imported, its in Draft status by default. This status can be seen in the Status/Actions column. To change the Draft status to Dry Run status, click on the drop down arrow and select **Dry Run** option.
