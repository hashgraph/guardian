# Fine-Grained Policy Workflow Certification Labels

### Overview

The Fine-Grained Policy Workflow Certification Labels feature enables users to classify, track, and certify specific components within a policy by applying meaningful tags at the policy-block level. These tags improve transparency, auditability, and traceability across policy creation, publication, and document generation workflows.

This capability is especially useful for certification-driven use cases where individual policy blocks contribute evidence, claims, or compliance artifacts that must be clearly identified and surfaced downstream.

### Goals and Objectives

* Enable granular tagging of policy blocks for certification and compliance workflows
* Allow consistent propagation of tags from policy blocks to generated artifacts
* Improve visibility of certified content across the Document Viewer and Indexer
* Support scalable tagging through multi-select and bulk operations

### Key Concepts

#### Policy Block

A Policy Block is an individual, configurable unit within a policy (e.g., schemas, modules, calculations, document generation steps).

#### Tags

Tags are user-defined labels applied to policy blocks to indicate certification status, compliance relevance, or categorization (e.g., `Certified`, `Verified`, `Audit-Required`).

#### Block Artifacts

Block Artifacts are outputs generated by policy blocks, such as documents, records, or visual assets.
