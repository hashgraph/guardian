## 4 step process to complete Policy Wizard:

### Policy Description:

This step allows users to setup policy information such as name, description, policy tag and topic description.

### Policy Roles:

This step provides facilities to manage policy roles. Created Roles can be deleted by clicking on them.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Owner is the default policy role (Policy Owner) and cannot be deleted.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Policy Schemas

This step allows facilities to manage schemas in the policy by selecting schemas in the dropdown.

#### 3.1 {schema} configuration

At this stage users set roles which are able to view the document grid. Additionally they can set the _produced schema_ to configure _produced schema_ creation based on the current schema.

**Relationship schema** defines documents which will be placed in the relationships in the current schema (after creation).

**Initial for roles** field defines which roles will see this schema (instead of displaying grid immediately) after role choosing.

If **Approve and Reject** and **Minting tokens** are set to _enable_ the corresponding functions by this schema would be enabled. This additionally required to specify the token and the field in schema to be used in the minting rule.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: We can select multiple schemas by entering the schemas names separated by a delimiter: ",".
{% endhint %}

#### 3.1.1 {role} configuration

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This step allows:

1. To set _approver_ (only if _Approve and Reject functionality_ is enabled)
2. _creator_ flags for the selected role.
3. Also allows to select _grid columns_ (ordering is supported).

### 4. TrustChain

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This step allows to set up users which are able to view grids with VPs and the grid with the trust chain.

#### 4.1. {role} configuration

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this step, Users can choose a minting schema which will be displayed on the trust chain. Additionally, visibility for VPs can be configured to â€˜only own â€˜ (recommended for the roles other than OWNER) or to â€˜allâ€™.

## Save/Recovery Process

After the policy in the wizard is configured, users can click on â€˜Createâ€™ and thereby save the progress of the wizard configuration to be able to restore it later.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

1. If â€˜Cancel' is clicked, then the wizard progress will be removed.
2. Progress will be automatically removed when policy is published.
{% endhint %}

Next time, when the wizard is opened a dialog with the selector of wizard states would be displayed, where we can select respective policy and restore progress.
