# ℹ️ API Versioning & Deprecation Policy

Guardian platform is evolving rapidly, new capabilities are frequently introduced which expand the set of supported use-cases. Changes in the underlying platform functionality inevitably get reflected in the API - to expose them to the end users and enable the development of new applications and/or new integrations. This can result in some features being removed, i.e. some APIs becoming obsolete, which necessitates changes in 3rd party applications which relied on them.&#x20;

To manage and coordinate this process Guardian follows a deprecation policy for aspects of the API that are scheduled to be removed.&#x20;

### API Versioning

The Guardian API is versioned using “Header Versioning” method as described in [Nest.js versioning guide](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/versioning). Each endpoint is versioned independently to minimize required changes in client applications via fine-grained scope management. All endpoints provide ‘default’ version API, which is used by the server when no version has been specified by the client. &#x20;

The API uses simple incremental numeric versioning (e.g. version ‘1’, version ‘2’, etc) to simplify tracking and management. Versions are incremented when the code update introduced breaking changes. Currently only a subset of endpoints provide non-default API versions, as only these endpoints have had breaking changes introduced to their specification.&#x20;

### Compatibility policy

Wherever possible, API resources, operations, parameters, and models are kept backward compatible with earlier versions. A new API element is created if/when it is necessary to make a non-backward compatible change. The old API element is maintained in accordance with the API deprecation policy.

#### Non-Breaking changes

The non-breaking changes to the API which do not warrant the change in the version number include two types:&#x20;

* Additions&#x20;
  * New optional fields and headers&#x20;
  * New allowed value&#x20;
  * New HTTP method to an API interface&#x20;
  * New resource URI extending existing endpoint&#x20;
  * New error condition covered by an existing error message&#x20;
* Changes in the description&#x20;

#### Breaking changes

* Removing an API endpoint, HTTP method or enum value&#x20;
* Renaming an API endpoint, HTTP method or enum value&#x20;
* Changing the type of the field&#x20;
* Changing behaviour of an API requests&#x20;

### Deprecation policy

Deprecation notice is used to inform the API users that a specific API facility is now considered obsolete and thus no longer advised for the use in applications. The notice is issued at least 3 months before the end-of-life date.&#x20;

The notice is issued via Swagger, where API being deprecated are marked with the deprecated tag, and via the Release Notes where the end-of-life date is also specified.&#x20;

An API may be changed without prior warnings if the existing behaviour if invalid or to patch a security vulnerability.&#x20;
