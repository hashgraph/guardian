# Formula Linked Definitions

Formula Linked Definitions enable users to view human readable mathematical representations of the calculation functionality of policies whenever they look at relevant schemas, policies or documents with data. Users are able to see how the formulas calculate the values, i.e. this functionality allows to browse associations between fields in schemas or documents and the corresponding variables in the displayed math formulas. Variables in formulas could also be associated with other formulas, thereby Guardian allows users to navigate the hierarchy of formulas and the data they represent, and view mapping variables in the formula to fields in schemas.
