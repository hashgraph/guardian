# Policy Labels

Policy Labels functionality enables Guardian users to create and publish assessment and evaluation tools (‘Label definitions’) for tokens and their provenance data. These tools can be applied to any tokens to automatically verify if the tokens/data satisfy conditions/rules defined in the Label. These conditions can be of significant complexity, which is conveniently hidden from end users behind simple wizard-like UI. Thus, Labels can be used by individuals to assess properties of tokens without knowledge of methodologies and/or mathematical skills. Labels can be applied to issued tokens/data retrospectively, the results of evaluations (‘Label documents’) can be published or kept private.
