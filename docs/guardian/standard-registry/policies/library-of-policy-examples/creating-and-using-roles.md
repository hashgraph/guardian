# ðŸ’» Creating and using Roles

For a demo example of following steps, here is the policy timestamp: **1675164531.823309003**

## **User roles usage in Policies**

### **An example of creating and using Roles in Policy**

1. Switch to the Roles tab

![Roles Tab](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

2. Create 2 new roles called â€˜**Example role 1**_â€™ and_ â€˜_**Example role 2**_â€™

![Creating two roles](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (9).png>)

3. In the root container create 4 more â€™**interfaceContainerBlock**_â€™_ container called â€˜**no\_role**_â€™_, â€˜**owner**_â€™_, â€˜**role\_1**_â€™ and â€˜_**role\_2**_â€™_

![Creating 4 interfaceContainerBlock](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (7).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** By default all containers would have â€˜_Any Roleâ€™_ set and thus they would be visible to all users (with all roles)
{% endhint %}

4. Change the â€˜Permissionsâ€™ properties in each container in the following way:

* no\_role: No Role
* owner: Owner
* role\_1: Example role 1
* role\_2: Example role 2

![No Role](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (5).png>) ![Owner](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (7).png>)

![Example role 1](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (6).png>) ![Example role 2](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (7).png>)

This would result in the following visibility of containers:

* The first container (called â€™no roleâ€™) would be visible only to new users which have no role assigned to them
* The â€˜ownerâ€™ container would be visible only to the Standard Registry which created (or imported) this policy
* The â€˜role 1â€™ container would be visible only to users with â€˜_Example role 1â€™_
* The â€˜role 2â€™ container would be visible only to users with â€˜_Example role 2â€™_

5. Add a â€˜**policyRolesBlock**_â€™_ to the â€˜_no\_roleâ€™_ container and name it â€˜_choose\_roleâ€™_

![Adding policyRolesBlock](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (6).png>)

Since this block is located inside the container â€˜_no\_role_â€™ which has â€˜_No role_â€™ permission setting it would only be visible to new users without an assigned role.

6. The â€˜**Available Roles**_â€™_ property allows to configure which roles would be available to users to chose from at this stage of the Policy workflow

Select â€˜**Example role 1**_â€™ and_ â€˜**Example role 2**_â€™_

![Available Roles property](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (5).png>)

7. Add â€˜**informationBlock**â€™ to other containers just to display results

![InformationBlock to other containers](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (7).png>)

### **Results**:

1. New users would end up on the policy choice form upon entering the policy

![Selecting Role](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (1) (2).png>)

2. After the selection of the role users would see only 1 container corresponding to their roles

![Showing only 1 container](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (1) (2).png>)

3. The owner of the Policy (the Standard Registry user) upon executing the policy would skip the role selection form and would immediately end-up in the corresponding container
