# 💻 Creating and using Roles

For a demo example of following steps, here is the policy timestamp: **1675164531.823309003**

## **User roles usage in Policies**

### **An example of creating and using Roles in Policy**

1. Switch to the Roles tab

![Roles Tab](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (2).png>)

2. Create 2 new roles called ‘**Example role 1**_’ and_ ‘_**Example role 2**_’

![Add Role button](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (1) (1).png>)

![Creating two roles](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (1) (1).png>)

3. In the root container create 4 more ’**interfaceContainerBlock**_’_ container called ‘**no\_role**_’_, ‘**owner**_’_, ‘**role\_1**_’ and ‘_**role\_2**_’_

![Creating 4 interfaceContainerBlock](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (2) (2).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** By default all containers would have ‘_Any Role’_ set and thus they would be visible to all users (with all roles)
{% endhint %}

4. Change the ‘Permissions’ properties in each container in the following way:

* no\_role: No Role
* owner: Owner
* role\_1: Example role 1
* role\_2: Example role 2

![No Role](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1) (2).png>) ![Owner](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (1) (2).png>)

![Example role 1](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (1) (1) (1).png>) ![Example role 2](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (1) (2).png>)

This would result in the following visibility of containers:

* The first container (called ’no role’) would be visible only to new users which have no role assigned to them
* The ‘owner’ container would be visible only to the Standard Registry which created (or imported) this policy
* The ‘role 1’ container would be visible only to users with ‘_Example role 1’_
* The ‘role 2’ container would be visible only to users with ‘_Example role 2’_

5. Add a ‘**policyRolesBlock**_’_ to the ‘_no\_role’_ container and name it ‘_choose\_role’_

![Adding policyRolesBlock](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (1) (1) (1).png>)

Since this block is located inside the container ‘_no\_role_’ which has ‘_No role_’ permission setting it would only be visible to new users without an assigned role.

6. The ‘**Available Roles**_’_ property allows to configure which roles would be available to users to chose from at this stage of the Policy workflow

Select ‘**Example role 1**_’ and_ ‘**Example role 2**_’_

![Available Roles property](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (1) (1) (1).png>)

7. Add ‘**informationBlock**’ to other containers just to display results

![InformationBlock to other containers](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (1) (3).png>)

### **Results**:

1. New users would end up on the policy choice form upon entering the policy

![Selecting Role](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (3).png>)

2. After the selection of the role users would see only 1 container corresponding to their roles

![Showing only 1 container](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (2) (2).png>)

3. The owner of the Policy (the Standard Registry user) upon executing the policy would skip the role selection form and would immediately end-up in the corresponding container
