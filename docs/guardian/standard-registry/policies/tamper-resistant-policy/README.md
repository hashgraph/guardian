# Tamper Resistant Policy

### Overview

The Tamper-Resistant Policy feature in Hedera Guardian ensures transparency and integrity of policies that are imported into the system. It allows users to track, verify, and compare changes made to a policy after import, helping auditors, developers, and business users confirm that a policy has not been altered unexpectedly or maliciously.

This feature is particularly valuable for compliance-driven workflows where policy immutability, traceability, and trust are critical.

### Key Objectives

* Preserve the original state of an imported policy
* Detect and surface modifications made after import
* Enable visual comparison between original and current policy versions
* Improve trust, auditability, and governance of Guardian policies
