# splitBlock

This block allows to accumulate VC documents and produce new VCs in fixed chunks.

If the value in the VC is higher than the chunking threshold the VC would be “spilt” into multiple VCs containing values equal to the threshold value.

## 2. Data(VC documents) format

After ‘splitting’ of the VC document into several chunks these new created VCs will contain:

1. All fields except the ‘source field’ copied without any changes.
2. Added **evidence** section of the following content:

```
{
            "type": [
                "SourceDocument"
            ],
            "messageId": "1655895001.624621306",
            "sourceField": "document.credentialSubject.0.field0",
            "sourceValue": 200,
            "threshold": 50,
            "chunkNumber": 1,
            "maxChunk": 4
        }

```
