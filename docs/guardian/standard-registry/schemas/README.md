# 🛠 Schemas

From an Environmental perspective, schemas contain environmentally-oriented vocabularies of terms for representing machine- and human-comprehensible structured data. In other words, they are linguistic “templates”, “frames”, or “patterns” together with rules for using them to specify a potentially infinite multitude of numbers, phrases, sentences, or arguments, which represent environmental data.

In Guardian, various environmental data produced in the course of executing policy workflows are packaged into JSON documents such as verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations. Schemas define the structure and content of these verifiable documents, enabling their automatic processing and provenance verification. It’s critical that all data required to be presented and or collected during a policy workflow has a well-defined verifiable credential schema. The schema will be used in the structural conformance verification of a document within a policy workflow.
