# How to handle large location files?

## 1. Step By Step:

1. Users can upload **.kml** or **.json** files to populate _geoJson_ fields with locations.

2. The imported locations appear as grey shapes overlaid on the map.

To select a location, click its shape on the map. The shape will be highlighted in green, and its textual definition will appear in the editable panel below the map. You can add, modify, or delete multiple locations. Clicking a selected location again will deselect it.

3. You can also use the **“Include all”** option to import all locations from the uploaded file.

**Note:** Web browsers limit the size of items they can render. The exact threshold depends on the host computer’s hardware and operating system configuration. If an uploaded file exceeds these limits, Guardian UI displays a warning message.
{% endhint %}

4. When these limits are reached, Guardian UI also provides an option to download the files by clicking the corresponding button in a modal window.
