After clicking on the New button, you will be asked to enter Schema details such as Schema Name, Policy Dropdown, Entity : VC/MRV/NONE, Schema Description and any other required fields.

In addition to the basic Schema details we also have an option to add Field and Condition to each field.

We can also add Property dropdown field to each field in Schema. these properties are defined by IWA and are in standardized format.

We can select respective property for that specific field by searching by entering starting alphabet:

We can also customize the Field keys and Field Title by clicking on Advanced Tab.

Instead of creating a new Schema from scratch, there is also an option to import it via File or via IPFS.

To import the Schema, click on the Import button.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Files with **.schema** extension are only accepted. These files are in zip format, i.e. they are zip archives of the text file.
{% endhint %}

#### Import from IPFS

You can also import Schema from IPFS by entering the correct Schema timestamp.&#x20;

Sample iREC Schema timestamp is below:

```
1707126011.005978889 (iREC 3 Policy)
```

Once the Schema is imported, we need to select the Policy from the Policy dropdown to connect the Schema and the Policy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The major difference between creating / importing System Schema and Policy Schema is that we only get policy selection dropdown when policy schema is imported.
{% endhint %}

After selecting the required Policy, click on the Import button.

When the Schema is imported, it will be in draft status.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Initially when the Schema is created/imported, it will be in draft status.
{% endhint %}

Once the Schema is imported, we will have the following options:\
1\. Export the Schema and save it as .zip file in the local machine

2\. Editing the Schema

3\. Deleting the Schema

4\. Displaying JSON document

To Publish the Schema, click on Publish button.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After clicking on Publish, you will be prompted to enter the version. After entering the Version and pressing the submit button, the status will change to Published.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: All Schemas connected to a Policy gets published automatically when Policy gets published.
{% endhint %}
