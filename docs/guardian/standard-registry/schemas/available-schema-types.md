# Available Schema Data Types

## **Embracing GBBC Specifications for Universal Data Comparability**

In the Guardian, the Property Glossary serves a pivotal role in harmonizing data across the entire ecosystem. Leveraging the standards set forth in the [GBBC dMRV Specification](https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Digital-Measurement-Reporting-Verification-dMRV-Framework.pdf) (and beyond), the glossary establishes a unified framework for interpreting and mapping data, ensuring that information collected through various schema formats remains consistent, comparable, and searchable.

## **The Need for Standardized Data Mapping**

The complexity of environmental reporting and digital asset management is compounded when dealing with varied methodologies and schema designs. To address this, the Guardian implements a standardized approach to data mapping, allowing for effective comparison and analysis of project data, regardless of its original schema format. This standardization is vital for:

1. **Ensuring Consistency:** Regardless of how data is formatted in individual schemas, standardizing property definitions ensures a consistent approach to interpreting and comparing data.
2. **Facilitating Comparability:** By using a common language for data properties, the Guardian enables users to effectively compare and analyze data from similar or different methodologies.
3. **Enhancing Searchability:** Standardized properties allow for more efficient data retrieval, making it easier to locate specific information across various projects and schemas.

## **Role of the Property Glossary**

The Property Glossary in MGS is more than just a list of definitions; it is a tool for aligning data across the platform. It includes a table of **Standardized Property Definitions.** Drawing from the GBBC Specification, the glossary provides clear definitions for each property, ensuring a common understanding across the platform.

**Introduction**

In the realm of digital environmental assets and carbon offset tokens, data is king. The essence of creating verifiable and trustworthy digital assets lies in the quality and structure of the underlying data. This is where the concept of "Schema Types" comes into play. Schemas serve as the backbone of data organization, ensuring that every piece of information adheres to a predefined format, thereby maintaining consistency, accuracy, and reliability.

**Purpose of Schema Types**

Schema Types are not just about data organization; they are about setting a standard for data integrity and trustworthiness. By defining clear structures and formats for data entry, storage, and retrieval, schemas facilitate:

1. **Standardization and Uniformity:** Ensuring all data across various projects and methodologies conforms to a consistent structure, enabling seamless integration and comparison.
2. **Flexibility and Customization:** Catering to diverse needs by allowing modifications to fit specific project requirements without compromising data integrity.
3. **Efficient Data Management:** Streamlining the process of data handling, from input to analysis, ensuring that data-driven decisions are based on accurate and reliable information.

**Role in Digital Environmental Assets**

The utilization of Schema Types is pivotal for the lifecycle of digital environmental assets. From the initial stages of data collection to the final phases of token creation and verification, schemas ensure that each step is backed by solid, verifiable data. This approach not only enhances the credibility of the digital assets but also boosts confidence among stakeholders in the carbon market ecosystem.

**Note: Important points to be noted when "Account" type is selected:**

1. Account field type need to be referred in â€˜tokenConfirmationBlockâ€™ and â€˜tokenActionBlockâ€™. They can be present both in the parent and child documents.
2. If there are multiple fields of the â€˜Accountâ€™ with the same name, then the value from the most immediate scope, i.e. from the current (â€˜childâ€™) document is used.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Important points to be noted when "Enum" type is selected:**

1. Enum values can be added by editing or by importing it from link or from file.
2. If we are importing files by URL. The response should be ({"enum": \["Option1", "Option2", "Option3"]}) or has same format such as importing file (Options separated by new line symbol).

Example of URL which has correct format: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreihgbx6fsqup4psfbzjcf57zjdbfwisbjbsqzvwlg4hgx5s5xyqwzm](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreihgbx6fsqup4psfbzjcf57zjdbfwisbjbsqzvwlg4hgx5s5xyqwzm)

3\. If we put more than five options, it will be automatically loaded to IPFS.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Important points to be noted when "GeoJSON" type is selected:**

1. Click on map and place the markerâ€™s, polygons, lines.
2. Polygons and lines can be placed by double clicking on map.
3. Right Click on the map will remove temporary points for polygons and lines
4. View type can also be changed by pasting the GeoJSON.
5. We can upload .kml, .json files to add locations. More details on this can be found in this [doc](how-to-handle-large-location-files.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Important points to be noted when "String" type is selected:**

1. Pattern input field is added in the advanced mode configuration.

Detailed information for patterns is available on [https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/regular\_expressions.html](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/regular_expressions.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
For all fields of type string with different formats (e.g., `url`, `uri`, `file`), an IPFS validator has been added.

* If the value looks like an IPFS link or must be an IPFS link (depending on the formatâ€™s internal validation), the field will validate against this requirement.
* The validation is applied only for published policies. For draft policies, validation is disabled.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For geoJSON fields :\


* A new property `availableOptions` has been added.
* On the UI, a dropdown list is displayed to select which geoJSON types are available.&#x20;
* If certain types are selected, then when creating a document, the `geoJSON` field will only allow choosing those specific types.
* Validation has also been added for the `geoJSON` field to ensure that values comply with the rules of the selected geoJSON type.
