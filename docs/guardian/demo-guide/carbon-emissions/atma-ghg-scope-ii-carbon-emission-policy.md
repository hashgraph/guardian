# üè≠ atma GHG Scope II Carbon Emission Policy

## Process Overview

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (34) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Process description

This policy supports the calculation of carbon emissions during the production lifecycle stage for one single product based on the measured energy consumption during production at the manufacturing site.

The calculated GHG emission values are aggregated on a monthly basis and the carbon emission token is minted at the end of each month.

Emissions calculated: (based on local emissions factors)

* CO2
* N2O
* CH4
* CO2e

## Limitations

Currently, only a single product type is supported per policy instance, however, it is possible to instantiate the policy multiple times in order to support multiple different products.

## Policy Guide

Once the Policy is imported, you will need to create another user account to be assigned the role of "Organization. Once you are signed in with the new user account, associate with the corresponding tokens, and go into the Policy screen. You will see a drop-down box to select the role of "Organization."

Next, fill out the Organization data form.

Once the form has been submitted, you'll need to define a product. Click on the "Define Product" button and fill out the product form.

The atma GHG policy issues an NFT token (AtmaProductToken) for every product that has been defined. Once the product has been defined, you can go out of the Policy screen and click over to the Profile screen. There you can click on the "Tokens" tab and notice that the token balance has been increased.

Once the product has been defined, you'll need to define the life cycle stage. Click on the "life cycle stage" button and fill out the life cycle stage form.

Once the life cycle for the product has been defined, you now need to record production data. Click on the "production data button" and fill out the production data form.

You can select the "Production Emission Data" tab to view the emissions from the product we just created.

Please note that the atma policy has a default "aggregation timer" to mint tokens every month. If you do not customize this option prior to publishing (or running on dry run) you will not see any tokens mint immediately.
