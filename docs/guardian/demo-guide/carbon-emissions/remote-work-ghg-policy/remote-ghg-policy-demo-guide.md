# üíª Remote GHG Policy Demo Guide

### For Organizations to Create an Employer (Employer Admin User)

Typically, the way we start the demonstration is by logging in as a Standard Registry called "GHG Remote Work". Create a user named "GHG Remote Work."

You'll now be prompted to configure your GHG Remote Work account. Enter the details and then press the Generate button to generate a Hedera Operator ID and an Operator Key and enter the name of your Standard Registry. Press Connect when finished. This will now create Hedera Consensus Service Topics, fill the account with test hBar, create a DID document, create a Verifiable Credential, etc

Now we will be creating the Policy. We have three ways to "create policies." The first way is to actually create the policy from scratch. The second way is to import an existing policy; either the policy file itself or from IPFS. When you import a policy, all schemas and tokens that are required in the policy are automatically populated. To do this, you can find the policy file and the IPFS timestamp on the open-source Guardian policy page [here](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Demo%20Artifacts/iREC). For this demo guide, we will be using the 3rd way to create a policy, which is through the preloaded drop-down list.

Once it is selected, we can also preview the policy before importing it. After the policy is imported, we can either run the policy in Dry run mode or we can publish it by clicking on publish button from the dropdown. For testing purposes, we will publish the policy.

Once the policy is published, we will log out and create a new user called, "Employer".

In the Profile screen, select ‚ÄúGHG Remote Work‚Äù and then click the ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

1. The timers in the GHG policy on MGS are set to intervals of hours, so you need to wait \~1.5 hours for minting tokens
2. You can make changes to this time period by changing time\_tracking\_timer and report\_timer blocks as shown below.

**For example** :\
**report\_timer:** 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58 \* \* \* \*

**time\_tracking\_timer:** 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,57,59 \* \* \* \*
{% endhint %}

You can view the number of tokens minted in the Policy Screen under the sub-table Mint‚Äôs VP column. You can explore the Trust Chain by clicking on the ‚ÄúView Document.‚Äù
