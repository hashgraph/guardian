# GHG Policy User Journey UI Demo Guide

**Here are the users that will be involved within this GHG policy demo UI:**

1. Standard Registry
2. Employer
3. Employee

You will need to run the installation commands, open a tab on your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

### GHG policy for the Standard Registry

Here in this demo for the Standard Registry, we will show the Standard Registry creating an account and importing the policy.

**GHG Policy IPFS timestamp: 1707206388.459759003**

**Step 1**

The first step is that you will need to either login in to your account that you have previously created or create a new account.

\
Here we will create a new account. You will need to click on **“Create new”** which will then lead you to the page to add the necessary information.

**Step 3**

Once you have added the correct details to configure your account, you will need to either use your own Hedera credentials or, if you do not have them, press the **“Generate”** button to generate a Hedera Operator ID and an Operator Key. This will create your Hedera Consensus Service Topic, show your hBar balance, DID document and a Verifiable Credential etc. Then click on **“Next”**

You will need to configure your account. You will need to enter the details shown in the image below.

**Step 4**

Once you have completed the previous steps you can then select **“Policies”** on the navigation menu. After you have selected “Policies” you will have the two options to either **“Create Policy”** or **“Import”** a policy.

\
Here we will want to click on **“Import”** policy.
