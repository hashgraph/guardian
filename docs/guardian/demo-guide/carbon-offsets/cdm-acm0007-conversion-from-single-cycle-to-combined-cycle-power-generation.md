### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The ACM0007 methodology titled "Conversion from single cycle to combined cycle power generation" provides guidance on quantifying emission reductions for projects that involve upgrading power plants from single cycle to more efficient combined cycle operation.

Combined cycle power generation makes use of waste heat from a gas turbine to produce steam and power a steam turbine, improving the overall efficiency of electricity generation. Converting existing single cycle turbines to combined cycle enables more electricity generation with the same fuel input, thereby reducing emissions intensity.

ACM0007 was designed to ensure accuracy in determining baseline emissions from continued single cycle operation and calculating project emissions from the combined cycle plant. It also accounts for any leakage emissions associated with the project activity.

By encouraging the switch to more efficient combined cycle technology, ACM0007 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development through improved utilization of resources.

### Need and Use for the ACM0007 Policy <a href="#need-and-use-for-the-acm0007-policy" id="need-and-use-for-the-acm0007-policy"></a>

Many developing countries have a high share of grid electricity generated from legacy single cycle gas turbines or diesel plants with low efficiencies and high emissions intensity.

Converting these power units to combined cycle can significantly reduce the grid emission factor by improving generation efficiency. This supports grid decarbonization efforts without compromising energy access and reliability.

The ACM0007 methodology provides a standardized approach to quantify the emission reductions achieved from upgrading power plants to combined cycle technology. This encourages project adoption by ensuring credibility and unlocking carbon finance opportunities.

Entities operating single cycle power plants can use ACM0007 to develop carbon offset projects by upgrading to combined cycle. The quantified emission reductions can potentially be registered under carbon crediting programs after independent validation. Revenue from carbon credits enhances the financial viability of efficiency improvement projects.

ACM0007 thus enables a practical solution to reduce grid emissions intensity in many countries by incentivizing combined cycle conversion projects through carbon market opportunities.

### Policy Workflow <a href="#policy-workflow" id="policy-workflow"></a>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (367).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Policy Guide <a href="#policy-guide" id="policy-guide"></a>

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp

### Available Roles <a href="#available-roles" id="available-roles"></a>

* Project participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.
* Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
* Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens
