## Introduction <a href="#toc2172532" id="toc2172532"></a>

This document outlines the GCCM001 v.4 methodology, titled _“Methodology for Renewable Energy Generation Projects Supplying Electricity to Grid or Captive Consumers.”_ This methodology was developed by the Global Carbon Council (GCC) to quantify the emission reductions from renewable energy generation projects. It supports projects like wind, solar, and hydropower, which displace fossil-fuel-based electricity generation, offering a standardized approach for calculating emission reductions, ensuring credible and reliable carbon credits.

## Need and Use <a href="#toc717005493" id="toc717005493"></a>

The GCCM001 v.4 methodology can be used by project developers implementing renewable energy projects. It offers a clear framework for calculating and verifying emission reductions from projects connected to public electricity grids or supplying captive consumers. The methodology helps project developers create projects that are environmentally sustainable and economically viable, supporting the transition to clean energy.

GCCM001 v.4 simplifies the monitoring and verification process, particularly through default values and flexible parameters that maintain the integrity of the emission reductions while minimizing monitoring costs. This approach allows renewable energy projects to generate credits that can be traded or used for offsetting emissions in carbon markets.

## Monitoring and Quantification Approach <a href="#toc1454682548" id="toc1454682548"></a>

The methodology provides detailed guidelines for establishing baseline emissions and tracking project performance. The key components include:

* **Renewable energy generation**: Continuous monitoring is required to measure electricity production, using calibrated metering systems.
* **Baseline emissions**: Baseline emissions are calculated using grid emission factors or captive power scenarios, which are determined by comparing the renewable energy output to emissions that would have been generated by conventional energy sources.
* **Emission reductions**: These are quantified by subtracting project emissions (if any) from baseline emissions.
* **Leakage**: No leakage emissions are anticipated under this methodology.

GCCM001 v.4 also provides flexibility in the selection of baseline emission factors, either through default factors or region-specific data, and ensures proper documentation of assumptions and calculations to maintain transparency.

## Project Eligibility and Additionality <a href="#toc232479138" id="toc232479138"></a>

Eligible projects under GCCM001 v.4 include renewable energy initiatives such as wind farms, solar parks, and small hydroelectric projects that supply electricity to grids or serve captive power needs. Additionality is demonstrated through evidence showing that the project would not have been implemented in the absence of revenue from carbon credits. This can be established via investment analysis, barrier analysis, or other tools as outlined by the methodology.

* **CDM Tool 01**: _Tool for Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality_ - This tool provides a step-by-step procedure to demonstrate that the proposed project activity is additional, meaning it would not have occurred in the absence of the carbon finance or regulatory incentives provided by carbon crediting. This is the most common tool for establishing additionality, using financial, technological, and institutional barriers.
* **CDM Tool 32**: _Positive List of Technologies_ - This tool provides a list of technologies that are automatically deemed additional without requiring further justification. These technologies are considered inherently beneficial to reducing GHG emissions and do not need further demonstration of barriers.
* **CDM Tool 19**: _Demonstration of Additionality of Microscale Project Activities_ - This tool specifically focuses on small-scale renewable energy projects. It provides simplified steps to demonstrate additionality, especially for micro-scale projects that typically involve fewer emissions and face less complex barriers.

## A1 Project Type <a href="#toc1065665469" id="toc1065665469"></a>

This digital policy is designed for **A1 projects** under the Global Carbon Council's (GCC) Methodology GCCM001 v4, "Renewable Energy Generation Projects Supplying Electricity to Grid or Captive Consumers." A1 projects represent a unique classification under the GCC Program, focusing specifically on projects that are not registered under any other greenhouse gas (GHG) program.

Key characteristics of A1 projects include:

* **Start Date**: Operations for A1 projects must begin on or after the approval of the relevant Project Standard and after the submission of a complete registration request.
* **Crediting Period**: The crediting period for these projects starts after the approval of the Project Standard and no later than one year after the operational start date.
* **Eligibility**: A1 projects are strictly limited to those not registered as a GHG Project Activity under any other program and that have not and will not issue carbon credits under any other GHG program.

The workflow outlined in this policy replicates the procedural steps required for A1 project types, covering project registration, the demonstration of additionality (using **CDM Tool 01**, **CDM Tool 32**, or **CDM Tool 19**), and the submission of monitoring reports to claim carbon credits under the A1 classification.
