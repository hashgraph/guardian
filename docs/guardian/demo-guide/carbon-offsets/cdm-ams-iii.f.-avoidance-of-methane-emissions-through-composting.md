### Introduction

AMS-III.F serves as a comprehensive methodology aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, specifically targeting the avoidance of methane release through controlled aerobic treatment, primarily via composting. This approach addresses the pressing global concerns of methane emissions from various organic waste sources and underscores the importance of sustainable waste management practices in combating climate change.

### Key Objectives and Scope

This methodology centers on:

Emission Avoidance: Preventing methane emissions that would otherwise occur from the anaerobic decay of biomass, organic matter in solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), animal waste management systems (AWMS), and wastewater treatment systems (WWTS).

Project Applicability: Applicable to composting activities involving municipal solid waste, biomass waste from agricultural/agro-industrial activities, including manure. Additionally, it encompasses the construction, expansion, and optimized utilization of treatment facilities.

Criteria for implementation: Sets a limit of 60 kt CO2 equivalent annually for emission reduction projects, emphasizes special efforts for capacity utilization, adherence to laws and regulations, and exclusion from other parallel CDM projects.

### Aspects of Methodology

AMS-III.F outlines specific steps and considerations:

Co-composting Practices: Encourages the utilization of wastewater in co-composting scenarios to enhance biological treatment, such as composting empty fruit bunches (EFB) with palm oil mill effluent (POME).

Baseline Establishment: Requires a clear understanding of baseline methane emissions from waste disposal sites and accounting for baseline emissions in co-composting scenarios.

Material and Waste Handling: Focuses on proper material blending for enhanced composting efficiency while monitoring quantities contributing to emission reduction calculations. Prior verification of identified landfill/stockpile capacity or regional waste disposal practices before diverting waste.

Geographical Boundary Definition: Demands defining the sourcing or transportation region for waste, considering transportation distance and final product usage.

Compost Management: Emphasizes proper soil application or controlled thermal/mechanical treatment to prevent methane emissions. Accounts for emissions if compost is stored anaerobically or sent to landfills.

### Significance and Environmental Impact

AMS-III.F's emphasis on controlled aerobic treatment of organic waste, notably through composting, signifies a pivotal step towards curbing methane emissions. By outlining stringent criteria for waste handling, regional considerations, and proper treatment methodologies, this policy contributes significantly to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and advancing sustainable waste management practices on a global scale.

### Policy Workflow

### Policy Guide

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp.

### Available Roles

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.

### Important Documents & Schemas

1. Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc.
2. Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions.
3. Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.

### Tools Referenced

* Methodological Tool 03 - Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
* Methodological Tool 04 - Emissions from solid waste disposal sites
* Methodological Tool 05 - Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation.
* Methodological Tool 13 - Project and leakage emissions from composting

### Token (Carbon Emission Reduction)

Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2.

### Step by Step

1. Log in as the Standard Registry and import the policy either by file or through IPFS timestamp by selecting the third button at the top right.
