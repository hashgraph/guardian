## **Introduction** <a href="#toc1498808060" id="toc1498808060"></a>

This document outlines the VM0042 v2.1 digital methodology, titled "Improved Agricultural Land Management." Developed by Envision, this digital methodology provides a standardized approach for quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and carbon sequestration from improved agricultural land management (ALM) practices. It supports projects that enhance soil carbon storage and reduce emissions from agricultural activities, generating verifiable carbon credits.

## **Policy Import** <a href="#toc508948431" id="toc508948431"></a>

This policy is published to the Hedera network and can be imported via GitHub (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp.

## **Available Roles** <a href="#toc11044525" id="toc11044525"></a>

### **1. Project Proponent** <a href="#toc468194060" id="toc468194060"></a>

The Project Proponent is responsible for the overall management and execution of the project. Key responsibilities include:

* Submitting project documentation to the Standard Registry and assigning Validators/Verifiers.
* Ensuring compliance with relevant methodologies and standards.
* Coordinating with stakeholders to facilitate project implementation and reporting.

### **2. Verifier(s)** <a href="#toc2068754974" id="toc2068754974"></a>

Verifiers are independent entities responsible for assessing the accuracy and validity of the project’s emission reduction and sequestration claims. Their key responsibilities include:

* Conducting thorough reviews of project documentation and emissions data.
* Performing on-site inspections and audits as necessary.
* Providing validation/verification reports to the Project Proponent and Standard Registry.

### **3. Standard Registry** <a href="#toc942028331" id="toc942028331"></a>

The Standard Registry serves as the authoritative body for maintaining project records. Responsibilities include:

* Managing the registration and tracking of approved projects.
* Ensuring compliance with established protocols and procedures.
* Facilitating communication with Verifiers and relevant oversight bodies.

## **Important Schemas** <a href="#toc735657324" id="toc735657324"></a>

#### **1. Project Proponent Registration** <a href="#toc1217573267" id="toc1217573267"></a>

Captures detailed information about the entity responsible for implementing the project, including legal name, registration details, and key personnel contacts.

#### **2. Verifier Registration** <a href="#toc48844107" id="toc48844107"></a>

Includes information about the verifying organization, such as credentials, contact details, and qualifications of personnel conducting verifications.

#### **3. Project Submission Form** <a href="#toc1392182971" id="toc1392182971"></a>

A formal document outlining project details, including baseline conditions, applied ALM practices, expected emission reductions, environmental assessments, and stakeholder consultations.

#### **4. Validation Report** <a href="#toc2085950723" id="toc2085950723"></a>

The Validation Report is a formal document summarizing the assessment of the project’s design before implementation. It ensures that the project meets the eligibility criteria and complies with the methodology requirements. The report includes:

* A review of baseline scenario selection.
* Assessment of additionality demonstration.
* Validation of monitoring plans and emission reduction estimates.
* Identification of risks and uncertainties.

#### **5. Verification Report** <a href="#toc1211181803" id="toc1211181803"></a>

Summarizes the findings of the verification process, assessing compliance with methodologies and the accuracy of reported emission reductions and sequestration.

#### **6. Monitoring Report** <a href="#toc129336738" id="toc129336738"></a>

A periodic report prepared by the Project Proponent tracking project performance, including soil carbon changes, emissions data, and compliance with monitoring requirements.

#### **7. Emission Reductions** <a href="#toc425742197" id="toc425742197"></a>

The Emission Reductions schema documents the calculation of emission reductions achieved by the project.

#### **8. AR-TOOL14: Estimation of Carbon Stocks** <a href="#toc191683315" id="toc191683315"></a>

This schema supports the estimation of carbon stocks and changes in carbon stocks for trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities.

#### **9. TOOL24: Common Practice** <a href="#toc1543566856" id="toc1543566856"></a>

This schema defines how common practice analysis is conducted within the context of emission reduction projects.

#### **10. AR-AM TOOL04: Testing Significance of GHG Emissions** <a href="#toc23326168" id="toc23326168"></a>

This schema provides guidance on determining whether a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission source is significant within an A/R CDM project.

Additionally, we have successfully digitized the A/R Methodological tool: _Estimation of Carbon Stocks and Change in Carbon Stocks of Trees and Shrubs in A/R CDM Project Activities_ during this phase. While it is not directly integrated into the digital methodology flow for VM0042 V2.1, it will be included in the methodology library for CDM tools, making it available for those interested in utilizing it for their A/R CDM projects.

## **Monitoring and Quantification Approach** <a href="#toc168154108" id="toc168154108"></a>

The methodology provides detailed guidelines for establishing baseline emissions and tracking project performance. Key components include:

* **Baseline Scenario:** Defines baseline land management practices and associated emissions.
* **Project Scenario:** Details the improved ALM practices implemented to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions.
* **Carbon Stock Changes:** Quantified using soil sampling, modeling, or default factors to track changes in soil organic carbon.
* **Emissions Reductions:** Calculated by comparing emissions in the baseline and project scenarios, accounting for avoided emissions and increased sequestration.
* **Leakage Assessment:** Evaluates potential emissions displacement outside project boundaries and applies necessary adjustments.
* **Uncertainty Analysis:** Ensures data reliability by quantifying the range of possible values in estimated reductions.

## **Project Eligibility and Additionality** <a href="#toc361494950" id="toc361494950"></a>

Eligible projects under VM0042 v2.1 include agricultural initiatives that improve land management practices to increase soil carbon and reduce emissions. Additionality is demonstrated through:

* **Financial Barriers:** Evidence showing the project would not have been viable without carbon finance.
* **Regulatory Surplus:** Ensuring the project goes beyond regulatory requirements.
* **Common Practice Analysis:** Demonstrating that the applied ALM practices are not widely adopted without incentives.

## **Verified Carbon Unit (VCU)** <a href="#toc124355767" id="toc124355767"></a>

Each Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) represents one metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions reduced or removed.

## **Need and Use** <a href="#toc1740233143" id="toc1740233143"></a>

VM0042 v2.1 provides a clear framework for ALM projects to generate high-integrity carbon credits. By enhancing soil health and reducing emissions, the methodology supports sustainable agricultural practices while enabling participation in carbon markets. It facilitates:

* Increased adoption of regenerative agricultural practices.
* Cost-effective monitoring approaches.
* Verifiable carbon credit issuance for project developers.

## **Workflow Implementation** <a href="#toc163225995" id="toc163225995"></a>

The digital policy for VM0042 follows structured procedural steps, covering project registration, monitoring, validation, verification and credit issuance. The implementation is in alignment with Verra’s standards and supports transparent reporting and verification within a distributed ledger environment.
