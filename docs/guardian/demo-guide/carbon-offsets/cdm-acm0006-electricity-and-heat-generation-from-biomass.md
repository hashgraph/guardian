### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

A key component in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, ACM0006 methodology, centers on large-scale electricity and heat generation from biomass. Developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), it provides a framework to address greenhouse gas emissions. This is achieved by focusing on the installation of new biomass-based power and heat plants, improving the energy efficiency of existing plants, and replacing fossil fuels with biomass, thus fostering sustainable energy generation. ACM0006 is crucial in the context of mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions.

This methodology provides a comprehensive approach towards quantifying emissions and reductions achieved through advanced technologies used for power and heat generation from biomass. When not fully utilized, these technologies can lead to significant carbon emissions, exacerbating global warming. ACM0006 paves the way to prevent this, highlighting the potential of biomass as a valuable renewable energy source.

The robustness of ACM0006 is underlined by integrating several methodological tools, each designed to ensure consistency and accuracy in emission calculations. These include "Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion," "Tool to calculate baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption," and "Tool to determine the remaining lifetime of equipment," among others. These tools provide a reliable foundation for calculating baseline emissions, project emissions, leakage, and emission reductions, reinforcing ACM0006 as a comprehensive approach to sustainable energy practices.

Significantly, ACM0006 acknowledges the environmental implications associated with conventional power and heat generation practices and proposes a sustainable approach. By adhering to this methodology, emissions into the atmosphere can be significantly reduced, ensuring sustainable development and promoting environmental preservation.

### Need and Use for the ACM0006 Policy <a href="#need-and-use-for-the-acm0006-policy" id="need-and-use-for-the-acm0006-policy"></a>

Worldwide, the call to curb greenhouse gas emissions is growing louder, and it's in this scenario that ACM0006 becomes critically important. Conventional methods of power and heat generation, often reliant on fossil fuels, contribute significantly to carbon dioxide emissions, the primary driver of global warming. ACM0006 promotes a vital shift towards renewable energy sources, specifically biomass, in large-scale power and heat generation projects.

Power and heat generation industries are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. ACM0006 provides a detailed framework for such projects to make a transition towards sustainable practices, primarily by using biomass. This not only helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also encourages the utilization of renewable energy resources, thus contributing positively to global efforts against climate change.

In the modern landscape of emission reduction initiatives, the value of transparency and credibility can't be overstated. Guardian, built on Hedera's Hashgraph DLT, ensures immutable and transparent record-keeping, thereby enhancing the accountability of such initiatives. By streamlining processes, enhancing accuracy, and fostering trust within renewable energy projects, ACM0006 bolsters its environmental impact, showcasing how innovation can drive us towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.

### Policy Workflow <a href="#policy-workflow" id="policy-workflow"></a>

### Policy Guide <a href="#policy-guide" id="policy-guide"></a>

This policy is published to Hedera network and can either be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPSF timestamp.

### Available Roles <a href="#available-roles" id="available-roles"></a>

* Project participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.
* Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.
* Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens
