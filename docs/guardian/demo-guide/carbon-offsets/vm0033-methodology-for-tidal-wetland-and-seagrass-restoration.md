## Introduction

VM0033 is a methodology developed for tidal wetland and seagrass restoration projects under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). As the world faces increasing threats from climate change and sea level rise, the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems has become a critical strategy for both carbon sequestration and coastal resilience. VM0033 provides a framework for quantifying and crediting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from restoration activities in these vital ecosystems.

This methodology focuses on interventions that restore, create, or manage hydrological conditions, sediment supply, salinity characteristics, water quality, and/or native plant communities in tidal wetlands and seagrass meadows. By enhancing these ecosystems' ability to sequester carbon and reduce GHG emissions, VM0033 offers a pathway for generating carbon credits while simultaneously providing crucial ecosystem services such as flood protection, water quality improvement, and habitat for marine life.

VM0033 is designed to be applicable globally, encompassing a wide range of tidal wetland systems including tidal forests (such as mangroves), tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows. The methodology provides detailed procedures for estimating baseline emissions, project emissions, and net GHG reductions. It accounts for various carbon pools including biomass (above and below ground), soil organic carbon, and in some cases, wood products.

Key features of VM0033 include:

1. Procedures for estimating carbon stock changes in biomass and soil.
2. Methods for accounting for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
3. Approaches for addressing the effects of sea level rise on project boundaries and emissions.
4. Consideration of factors such as allochthonous carbon and the long-term storage of carbon in wood products.

By providing a standardized approach to quantifying GHG benefits from these restoration activities, VM0033 enables project developers to access carbon finance, potentially making more restoration projects economically viable. This methodology thus represents an important tool in the global effort to mitigate climate change while protecting and enhancing critical coastal and marine ecosystems.

## Need and Use for the VM0033&#x20;

The need for VM0033 arises from the urgent global imperatives of climate change mitigation and coastal ecosystem protection. Tidal wetlands and seagrass meadows are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, capable of sequestering carbon at rates far exceeding those of many terrestrial forests. However, these "blue carbon" ecosystems are also among the most threatened, facing pressures from coastal development, pollution, and sea level rise.

VM0033 addresses several critical needs:

1. Climate Change Mitigation: By providing a mechanism to quantify and credit GHG reductions from restoration activities, VM0033 incentivizes the protection and restoration of these highly effective carbon sinks.
2. Ecosystem Services: Beyond carbon sequestration, restored tidal wetlands and seagrass meadows provide numerous ecosystem services, including coastal protection, water quality improvement, and habitat for commercially important fish species.
3. Adaptation to Sea Level Rise: The methodology includes procedures for accounting for the effects of sea level rise, making it a valuable tool for coastal adaptation strategies.
4. Biodiversity Conservation: Many species depend on tidal wetlands and seagrass meadows. Restoring these ecosystems supports biodiversity conservation efforts.
5. Sustainable Development: VM0033 projects can contribute to multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including climate action, life below water, and sustainable communities.

The digitization of VM0033 on the **Hedera Guardian** enhances its utility by:

1. Increasing Accessibility: The digital format makes the methodology more easily accessible to project developers worldwide.
2. Improving Transparency: Blockchain-based recording of project data and calculations improves the transparency and auditability of carbon credits generated.
3. Streamlining Processes: Automation of many of the complex calculations required by the methodology, reducing the potential for errors and speeding up the verification process.
4. Facilitating Monitoring: Enabling more efficient and accurate monitoring of project outcomes over time.

VM0033 on Guardian platform is set to become a powerful tool for scaling up tidal wetland and seagrass restoration efforts globally, contributing significantly to both climate change mitigation and coastal ecosystem conservation.

## Available Roles

* Project Proponent: Responsible for implementing the restoration project, collecting data, and submitting project documentation. They must adhere to the methodology requirements and provide evidence of GHG emission reductions achieved.
* Verification and Validation Body (VVB): Independently verifies and validates the project data submitted by the project proponent. They assess the project's emission reduction calculations, methodologies, and adherence to VM0033 guidelines.
* Registry (Verra): Oversees the overall process, including project registration, methodology approval, and issuance of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs). They ensure that projects meet all necessary standards and requirements.

* Project Description: Detailed information about the project, including location, restoration activities, baseline scenario, project scenario and ex-ante estimation of GHG benefits.
* Monitoring Report: Periodic report detailing the project's performance, including data on carbon stock changes, GHG emissions, and other relevant parameters as specified in the methodology.
* GIS Files: Geospatial data delineating project boundaries, stratification, and monitoring plots.

## Token (Verified Carbon Uint)

Verified Carbon Units (VCUs), each equivalent to one tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere.

## Step By Step

1. Project Proponent creates an account and initiates a new project.
2. Project Proponent submits the Project Description and supporting documentation.
3. Verra reviews the submission for completeness and assigns a VVB.
4. VVB conducts validation of the project documentation.
5. Upon successful validation, Verra registers the project.
6. Project Proponent implements the project and collects monitoring data.
7. Project Proponent submits a Monitoring Report.
8. VVB verifies the Monitoring Report and emission reduction calculations.
9. Upon successful verification, Verra issues VCUs to the Project Proponent.
10. The issued VCUs are recorded on the Hedera ledger, ensuring transparency and traceability.
