### Introduction to AMS-I.F. &#x20;

AMS-I.F., under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a small-scale methodology titled "Renewable electricity generation for captive use and mini-grid." It is designed to facilitate the production of electricity using renewable energy technologies such as photovoltaic, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal, and renewable biomass. This methodology is crucial for projects that aim to displace electricity that would otherwise be provided to users by more GHG-intensive means, focusing primarily on sectoral scope 01.&#x20;

This methodology encompasses renewable energy generation units that supply electricity to users, displacing electricity from distribution systems that would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel-fired generating unit. It is applicable to various project activities, including the installation of new power plants at sites where there were no renewable energy power plants operating prior to the implementation of the project activity (Greenfield plant), capacity addition, retrofit of existing plants, and replacement of existing plants. &#x20;

### Need and Use for AMS-I.F. &#x20;

The need for AMS-I.F. arises from the imperative to mitigate the environmental impacts of electricity generation using fossil fuels, which are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is crucial for projects aiming to produce electricity using renewable energy technologies, thereby mitigating GHG emissions and contributing to environmental sustainability.&#x20;

AMS-I.F. is essential for projects that involve the production of electricity using various renewable energy technologies, promoting the utilization of clean and sustainable energy sources and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The methodology enables projects to displace electricity that would otherwise be supplied by more GHG-intensive means, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the mitigation of climate change impacts. By promoting renewable electricity generation for captive use and mini-grid, AMS-I.F. contributes to enhancing energy security and reducing dependence on fossil fuel-based electricity, fostering resilience and sustainability in energy systems.&#x20;

### Objective and Scope of AMS-I.F.&#x20;

The primary objective of AMS-I.F. is to provide a structured and standardized approach for small-scale renewable electricity generation projects for captive use and mini-grid. It aims to facilitate the displacement of GHG-intensive electricity by enabling the production of electricity using various renewable energy technologies.&#x20;

The scope of this methodology includes renewable energy generation units like photovoltaic, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal, and renewable biomass that supply electricity to users. It is applicable to a variety of situations, including new installations, capacity additions, retrofits, and replacements of renewable energy power plants, ensuring versatility and adaptability to different project needs and conditions. &#x20;

### Methodology Overview&#x20;

AMS-I.F. is comprehensive and versatile, covering various renewable energy technologies and applicable to different types of project activities. It mandates stringent criteria to ensure genuine emissions reductions and the displacement of GHG-intensive electricity. The methodology provides clear guidelines and conditions for the applicability based on project types, ensuring clarity and precision in its implementation. &#x20;

### Typical Projects&#x20;

Typical projects under AMS-I.F. involve the production of electricity using renewable energy technologies that supply electricity to users. These projects are pivotal in displacing electricity from GHG-intensive sources, contributing significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of environmental sustainability. They can range from new installations of renewable energy power plants to capacity additions, retrofits, and replacements, allowing for a broad spectrum of applications in different contexts and conditions. &#x20;

### Available Roles&#x20;

Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.&#x20;

Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.&#x20;

Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB and the endorsement by the DNA. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.&#x20;

### Key Documents and Schemas&#x20;

1. Project Description‚ÄØ- Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc.&#x20;
2. Emissions Reduction‚ÄØ‚Äì Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions.&#x20;
3. Monitoring Report‚ÄØ‚Äì The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.&#x20;

### Step-by-Step &#x20;

1. Log in as the Standard Registry and import the policy either by file or through IPFS timestamp by selecting the third button at the top right.

2. Once the policy has successfully imported, you will be redirected to the policy configurator. The policy configurator can be used to edit the policy using the workflow blocks. There will also be a tab for the ‚ÄúTools‚Äù used within this policy as illustrated in the image below. To start using the policy you must first change the status of the policy from ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù to ‚ÄúDry Run‚Äù or ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù, then select the ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo‚Äù button. This can be done through the policy configurator page or though the ‚ÄúPolicies‚Äù page.
