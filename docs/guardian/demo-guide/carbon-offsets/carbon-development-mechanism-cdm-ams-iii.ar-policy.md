## **Introduction**

\
AMS-III.AR is a specific methodology under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that aims to promote sustainable development by facilitating the substitution of fossil fuel-based lighting systems with energy-efficient LED/CFL lighting systems. This methodology focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with lighting and improving energy efficiency in developing countries. The objective of AMS-III.AR is to encourage the adoption of LED (Light Emitting Diode) and CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp) lighting technologies as alternatives to traditional fossil fuel-based lighting systems such as incandescent bulbs or kerosene lamps. LED and CFL lighting systems are more energy-efficient, have longer lifespans, and produce significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to their fossil fuel-based counterparts.

## **Why AMS-III.AR Methodology?**

\
Let's explore the drawbacks of fuel-based lighting and the compelling advantages offered by LED/CFL bulbs. It is widely acknowledged that fuel-based lighting falls short in terms of efficiency, delivering limited and low-quality illumination, while also subjecting users to significant health and fire hazards‚Äîespecially in low and middle-income countries, where over 95% of fatal fire-related burns occur. Furthermore, the use of fuel-based lighting contributes to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, leading to increased indoor air pollution, health risks, decreased productivity, and compromised safety. Astonishingly, the total fuel consumption for lighting, equivalent to a staggering 1.3 million barrels of oil per day, results in approximately 190 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.&#x20;

On the other hand, LED/CFL bulbs emerge as superior options, and here's why. First and foremost, they are highly energy-efficient, utilizing up to 80% less energy compared to conventional bulbs. This not only translates into substantial energy savings but also aids in reducing carbon emissions, making LED/CFL bulbs an eco-friendly choice. In addition to their energy efficiency, these bulbs boast an impressively long lifespan‚Äîup to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. This remarkable durability means fewer replacements, reduced waste generation, and lower maintenance costs. With LED/CFL bulbs, you can enjoy long-lasting illumination while minimizing your impact on the environment.&#x20;

Moreover, LED bulbs are designed with sustainability in mind. Unlike conventional bulbs, they do not contain harmful substances like mercury, making them safer for both human health and the planet. Additionally, LED bulbs produce minimal heat, further enhancing their safety and sustainability. While CFL bulbs do contain small amounts of mercury, it's important to note that switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs still offers energy savings, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels burned for electricity generation. Furthermore, the increased efficiency and extended lifespan of LED/CFL bulbs contribute to resource conservation during the production process.&#x20;

In conclusion, LED/CFL bulbs outshine fuel-based lighting on multiple fronts. They not only provide superior lighting quality but also bring significant energy savings, reduced carbon emissions, prolonged lifespan, and a more sustainable lighting solution. By adopting LED/CFL technology, we can make a positive impact on our environment. &#x20;

## **Policy Workflow**

## **Policy Guide**

This policy is published to the Hedera network and can either be imported via Github(.policy file) or IPFS timestamp.&#x20;

## **Available Roles**

**Project Participant** - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. They develop and implement strategies to substitute fossil fuel-based lighting systems with LED/CFL lighting systems. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ&#x20;

**Verification and Validation Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.‚ÄØ&#x20;

**Registry (UNFCCC)** - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens.‚ÄØ&#x20;

## **Important Documents & Schemas**

1. Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc.‚ÄØ&#x20;
2. Emissions Reduction ‚Äì Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions.‚ÄØ&#x20;
3. Monitoring Report ‚Äì The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ
