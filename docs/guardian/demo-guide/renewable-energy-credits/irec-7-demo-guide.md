# ðŸ’» iREC 7 Demo UI Guide

Following are the steps to run iREC 7 Policy.

1. We need to import the policy by using two steps : Either by importing the `IRec Policy 7 split documents (1707130249.448431277).policy` or through IPFS by entering the timestamp of the policy : 1707130249.448431277.

3\. Once imported, we can either run the policy in Dry run mode or we can publish it by clicking on publish button from the dropdown. For testing purpose, we will publish the policy.

4\. Once the policy is published, we will logout and login as Registrant.Once we login as Registrant, we will setup Registrant role by selecting Standard Registry from the dropdown, generating Operator ID and Operator Key as shown below:

11\. We login as SD and view the Issue Request and approve it by clicking on approve button. Once Issue request is approved, tokens are minted if the MRV data is more than 1000 KW as it is the threshold for splitting the data into chunks.
