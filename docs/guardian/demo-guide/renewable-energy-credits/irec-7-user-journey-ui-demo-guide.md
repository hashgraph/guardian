# 💻 iREC 7 User Journey UI Demo Guide

**Here are the users that will be involved within this iREC policy demo UI:**

1. Standard Registry
2. Standard User

### iREC for the Standard Registry

Here in this demo from the standard registry creating a new account, importing the iREC policy and approving the issue request from the Registrant.

**Step 1**

The first step is that you will need to either login in to your account that you have previously created or create a new account. To create a new account just click **“Create new”** or if you are logging just simply add your details to Log in.

**Step 2**

For this demo we will Create a new account.

You will need to follow the step below to Configure your account if you have selected **“Create new”**. And select the account type, in this case you will want to select “Standard Registry”

You will then need to add your User name, Password and Confirm Password, then you will click on **“Create”**.

Once you have added the correct details to configure your account, you will need to either use your own Hedera credentials or, if you do not have them, press the **“Generate”** button to generate a Hedera Operator ID and an Operator Key. This will create your Hedera Consensus Service Topic, show your hBar balance, DID document and a Verifiable Credential etc.

Afterwards, you will need to configure your account. You will need to enter the details shown in the image below.

Once completed your information that you have provided will start to process.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (176).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now you will be able to see your “User Profile”. You can also view your DID document, Verifiable Credential etc.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 3**

Once you have completed the previous steps you can see the navigation menu and select **“Policies”** . After you have selected **“Policies”** you will have the two options to either **“Create Policy”** or **“Import”** a policy.

Ideally for this flow we will want to import the iREC policy in which all schemas and tokens will be automatically populated.

**Step 4**

Once you have decided that you want to import the iREC 7 Policy, you will need to enter **1707130249.448431277** on the ‘Hedera message timestamp” pop up and click on the **“Ok”** button.

**Step 5**

Here we can have a preview of the iREC policy. Once you have reviewed the policy you can now click on the **“Import”** button.

**Step 6**

Once the policy has been imported we can now see the policy and decide whether to run the policy on Dry mode (test run of the policy) or publish the policy, by selecting the dropdown.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (162).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here we can see that we have published the iREC 7 policy.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (166).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 7 (only to continue if the Registrant have submitted their issue request)**

Once the Registrant has submitted their issue request and you have viewed the document, you can either **“approve”** or **“Reject”**. In this case we will **“Approve”**. Once you have approved it, the token is minted.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (153).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 8**

After you have approved their request, you would then be able to check the minted token within the **“Token History”** tab of the iREC policy. Here you can also view the TrustChain of the policy.

Step 9

You will also be able to **“Freeze”** or **“Revoke KYC”** to any user, in this case we can only do this to the Registrant.

### iREC for the Standard User (Registrant)

We will also see the Registrant creating an account, filling out their Registration form, and requesting an issue.

**Step 1**

The first step is that you will need to either login in to your account that you have previously created or create a new account. To create a new account just click **“Create new”** or if you are logging just simply add your details to Log in.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (217).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will want to set up your Registrant role and select the Standard registry (the entity responsible for establishing policy requirements and specifications) from the dropdown. You will need to either use your own Hedera credentials or, if you do not have them, press the **“Generate”** button to generate a Hedera Operator ID and an Operator Key. This will create your Hedera Consensus Service Topic, show your hBar balance, DID document and a Verifiable Credential etc. Then click on **“Submit”**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (218).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 3**

Once you have completed the previous step you will select the iREC 7 policy by clicking **“Go”**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (219).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then want to select your role which will be ‘Registrant’ from the dropdown and select **“Ok”** you will then need to fill in your Registrant application.
