# ðŸ“± Mobile Support for Data Interface

The introduction of this feature aims to be the first step to allow a more user friendly interaction between a mobile user on the field, for example, and Guardian. The changes introduced are exclusively cosmetic, not bringing any new logic nor removing what already exists. The list of the adaptations made is the following:

* Create a new account;
* New header for mobile;
* Users first registration into Guardian;
* User policy registration application;
* User creating a retire request;
* User Create / Join Multi Policy;
