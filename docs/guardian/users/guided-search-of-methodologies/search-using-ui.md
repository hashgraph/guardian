# ðŸ’» Search using UI

Guided Search can be performed by two ways:

1. Category based search
2. Integration with Methodology name search

## 1. Category-Based Search:

* Within a single group of categories, Guided Search utilizes a logical 'OR' approach. This means that if a methodology falls under any one of the specified categories within the group, it will be included in the search results.
* Across different groups of categories, a logical 'AND' criterion is applied. In this scenario, only methodologies that meet all category criteria across different groups will be shown in the results.

## 2. Integration with Methodology Name Search:

* Guided Search further enhances its functionality by allowing the combination of category-based searches with specific methodology name searches. This dual-search capability enables users to refine their search results more precisely.

## 3. Search Result:

The result of using Guided Search is a tailored list of policies that align closely with the user's specified categories and methodology names. This makes the process of finding relevant methodologies both efficient and user-friendly.
