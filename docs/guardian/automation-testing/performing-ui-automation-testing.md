# ðŸ’» Performing UI Automation Testing

Following command is used to run all UI tests in an interactive dashboard that allows you to see the status of the tests while they are running and at the same time view the application under test.

```
npm run ui-only 
```

To run a UI test for specific policy you can open Cypress dashboard by running the following command from /e2e-tests folder:

```
npx cypress open 
```

After executing this command, you will see a welcome window where you need to select

'E2E Testing' as shown below:
