## Policy Workflow Engine Fundamentals

The Policy Workflow Engine (PWE) is Guardian's core innovation, transforming certification processes into dynamic, executable workflows for environmental asset creation and verification.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Complexity Consideration**: VM0033 methodology contains intricate decision trees and calculation procedures requiring careful mapping to Guardian's workflow blocks for complete compliance.
{% endhint %}

**Core PWE Concept**: Environmental certification processes are sophisticated workflows where methodology-specific requirements (like VM0033's carbon accounting) are embedded within broader certification procedures involving multiple stakeholders, decision points, data collection, calculations, and verification steps.

**PWE Components for VM0033**:

**Workflow Block Types**:
- **Container Blocks**: Organize processes into logical groupings
- **Step Blocks**: Guide users through sequential procedures
- **Calculation Blocks**: Handle mathematical operations for carbon accounting
- **Request Blocks**: Manage extensive data collection requirements

**VM0033 Certification Process Implementation**:
- **Embedded Decision Logic**: VM0033's baseline determination integrated into broader project approval workflows
- **Automated Compliance**: VM0033's monitoring requirements embedded within ongoing certification processes
- **Integrated Calculations**: VM0033's carbon accounting procedures automated within broader verification workflows
- **Complete Process Management**: From project registration through credit issuance with embedded VM0033 compliance

**Automated Compliance Features**:
- **Requirement Enforcement**: Users cannot proceed without necessary data/validation
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform implementation across different projects
- **Error Reduction**: Automated validations reduces data input mistakes
- **Format Validation**: Specific data formats and approval workflows matching VM0033 requirements

**Stakeholder Coordination**:
- **Role-based Workflows**: Different interfaces and permissions for each stakeholder type
- **Governance Compliance**: Meets VM0033's complex governance requirements
- **Tailored Tools**: Each stakeholder gets specific tools and information needed

## Schema System and Data Management

Guardian's schema system provides the foundation for structured data management, defining data structures, validation rules, and relationships that ensure methodology compliance and enable automated processing.

**Schema Architecture**:

**System vs. Custom Schemas**:

**Time-Series Data Support**:
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Regular carbon stock, project activity, environmental condition monitoring
- **Time Spans**: Decades-long project lifetimes
- **Validation**: Built-in rules ensuring consistent formats and methodology compliance
- **Storage**: Optimized for long-term analysis and verification

**Calculation Support**:
- **Complex Equations**: Carbon stock changes, emission factors, uncertainty calculations
- **Input Management**: Ensures necessary data available in correct formats
- **Result Storage**: Structured formats supporting audit and verification
