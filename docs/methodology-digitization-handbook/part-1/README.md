# 🏗️ Part I: Foundation and Preparation

> Establishing the foundational knowledge for methodology digitization on Guardian platform

## Overview

Part I provides the essential foundation for understanding methodology digitization, the Guardian platform, and the VM0033 reference methodology. This part consists of three focused chapters designed to prepare readers for the technical implementation phases that follow.

## Chapters

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Methodology Digitization](chapter-1/)

### [Chapter 2: Understanding VM0033 Methodology](chapter-2/)

**Reading Time**: \~18 minutes **Purpose**: Provide domain knowledge of VM0033 before technical implementation

### [Chapter 2: Understanding VM0033 Methodology](chapter-2/)

**Reading Time**: \~18 minutes **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive domain knowledge of VM0033 before technical implementation

### [Chapter 3: Guardian Platform Overview](chapter-3/)

**Reading Time**: \~6 minutes **Purpose**: Introduce Guardian's technical architecture and capabilities for methodology developers

## Learning Outcomes

After completing Part I (\~32 minutes total reading time), readers will:

* Understand the methodology digitization process and its benefits
