# Chapter 27: Integration with External Systems

> Connecting Guardian-based methodologies with external registries, monitoring systems, and third-party tools

ðŸš§ **Chapter In Development** - This chapter is currently being written and will be available soon.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Design and implement advanced external system integration patterns
- Connect Guardian methodologies with carbon registries and monitoring systems
- Handle complex data transformation and synchronization requirements
- Implement real-time data feeds and streaming integration (Metered Policy examples)
- Manage data consistency and error handling across integrated systems
- Scale integration architecture for enterprise-level deployments

## Prerequisites
