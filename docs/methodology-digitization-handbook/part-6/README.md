# Part VI: Integration and Testing

> Complete methodology validation and production deployment preparation using Guardian's testing and API frameworks

Part VI transforms your methodology implementation from working calculations into production-ready systems. Using VM0033's patterns and Guardian's testing capabilities, you'll learn to validate complete workflows, automate operations through APIs, and prepare for large-scale deployment.

## Overview

Building on the calculation logic from Part V, Part VI focuses on system-level validation and operational readiness. These chapters teach you to test methodology implementations as complete systems, automate workflows through Guardian's API framework, and validate production readiness using real-world scenarios.

**Why Integration and Testing Matters:**
- Methodology implementations serve thousands of users across complex workflows
- Carbon credit accuracy and compliance depend on complete system validation  
- Production operations require automated data processing and error handling
- Integration with external systems enables scalable monitoring and reporting

## Part VI Structure

### [Chapter 22: End-to-End Policy Testing](chapter-22/README.md)
Test complete methodology workflows across all stakeholder roles using Guardian's dry-run capabilities. Learn to create virtual users, simulate multi-year project lifecycles, and validate complex state transitions using VM0033's production patterns.

**Key Learning:**
- Multi-role testing with virtual users (Project Proponent, VVB, Standard Registry)
- Complete workflow simulation from PDD submission to token issuance
- Production-scale data validation and performance testing
- Cross-component integration validation

### [Chapter 23: API Integration and Automation](chapter-23/README.md)
Automate methodology operations using Guardian's REST API framework. Build production-ready automation systems, integrate with external monitoring platforms, and create comprehensive testing suites for continuous validation.

**Key Learning:**
- Guardian API authentication and endpoint mapping
- Automated data submission using VM0033 policy block APIs
- Virtual user management for programmatic testing
- Cypress integration for automated regression testing

## Prerequisites
