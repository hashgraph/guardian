# Chapter 19: Formula Linked Definitions (FLDs)

> Understanding Guardian's parameter relationship framework for environmental methodologies


## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept and architecture of Formula Linked Definitions in Guardian
- Identify parameter relationships suitable for FLD implementation
- Plan FLD integration within customLogicBlock calculations
- Design parameter validation workflows using FLD patterns
- Recognize opportunities for FLD optimization in VM0033 calculations

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 18: Custom Logic Block Development
- Understanding of parameter dependencies from Part II: Analysis and Planning
- Familiarity with VM0033 calculation structure from [er-calculations.js](../../_shared/artifacts/er-calculations.js)

## Chapter Summary

Formula Linked Definitions provide a structured approach to managing parameter relationships in Guardian methodologies.
Key takeaways:

- **FLDs enable parameter reuse** across multiple schema documents in policy workflows
- **VM0033 offers clear examples** of parameter relationships suitable for FLD implementation
- **Integration with customLogicBlock** allows FLD values to be used in emission calculations
- **Validation frameworks** ensure FLD calculations maintain accuracy and compliance
- **Design principles** focus on simplicity, testability, and maintainability

### Next Steps

Chapter 20 will demonstrate implementing specific AR Tool calculation patterns, showing how the parameter relationships we've identified in FLDs translate into working calculation code for biomass and soil carbon assessments.
