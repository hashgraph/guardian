Managing document states, transitions, and approvals throughout the certification process. Includes status tracking and workflow orchestration.

## Part V: Calculation Logic Implementation

### Chapter 17: Custom Logic Block Development
Comprehensive guide to writing JavaScript/Python code for emission reduction(or removal) calculations, including VM0033-specific calculation examples and best practices.

### Chapter 18: Formula Linked Definitions (FLDs)
Understanding and implementing FLDs for complex calculation dependencies and parameter relationships in environmental methodologies.

### Chapter 19: Data Validation and Error Handling
Implementing robust data validation, error handling, and edge case management in calculation logic.

### Chapter 20: Calculation Testing and Verification
Methods for testing calculation logic against test artifacts, debugging calculation errors, and ensuring mathematical accuracy.

## Part VI: Integration and Testing

### Chapter 21: End-to-End Policy Testing
Comprehensive testing strategies including dry runs, role-based testing, and workflow validation using VM0033 scenarios.

### Chapter 22: API Integration and Automation
Using Guardian APIs for automated testing, data submission, and integration with external systems. Includes practical examples for VM0033 data submission.

## Part VII: Deployment and Maintenance

### Chapter 23: User Management and Role Assignment
Setting up user roles, permissions, and access controls for different stakeholders in the methodology workflow.

### Chapter 24: Monitoring and Analytics - Guardian Indexer
Implementing monitoring, logging, and analytics for deployed methodologies to track usage, performance, and issues.

### Chapter 25: Maintenance and Updates
Strategies for maintaining deployed methodologies, handling methodology updates, and managing backward compatibility.

## Part VIII: Advanced Topics and Best Practices
