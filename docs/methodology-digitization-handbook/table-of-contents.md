Practical schema validation using Guardian's testing features including Default/Suggested/Test values, preview testing, UUID integration, and pre-deployment checklist for production readiness.

## Part IV: Policy Workflow Design

### Chapter 13: Stakeholder Analysis and Role Definition

Identifying and defining all stakeholders in the methodology workflow (Standard Registry, VVB, Project Developer) and their interactions in the VM0033 context.

### Chapter 14: Carbon Credit Certification Workflow Design

Designing the complete certification workflow from project registration through credit issuance, including validation, verification, and approval processes.

### Chapter 15: Policy Workflow Block Configuration

Detailed guide to configuring each type of policy workflow block, including request blocks, send blocks, interface containers, and role management blocks.

### Chapter 16: Document Flow and State Management

Managing document states, transitions, and approvals throughout the certification process. Includes status tracking and workflow orchestration.

## Part V: Calculation Logic Implementation

### Chapter 17: Custom Logic Block Development

Comprehensive guide to writing JavaScript/Python code for emission reduction(or removal) calculations, including VM0033-specific calculation examples and best practices.

### Chapter 18: Formula Linked Definitions (FLDs)

Understanding and implementing FLDs for complex calculation dependencies and parameter relationships in environmental methodologies.

### Chapter 19: Data Validation and Error Handling

Implementing robust data validation, error handling, and edge case management in calculation logic.
