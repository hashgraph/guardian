# ðŸ”§ Shared Resources

> Common templates, frameworks, and systems used across all parts of the Methodology Digitization Handbook

## Overview

This directory contains shared infrastructure used across all parts (I-VIII) of the Methodology Digitization Handbook to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## Shared Components

### [Templates](templates/)

Standard templates for consistent content structure across all chapters and parts

### [VM0033 Integration System](vm0033-integration/)

System for ensuring accurate VM0033 references throughout all handbook content

### [Guardian Integration](guardian-integration/)

System for linking handbook content with existing Guardian documentation

### [Artifacts Collection](artifacts/)

Test artifacts, calculation tools, and reference materials for methodology validation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Content Developers

1. **Use Standard Templates**: All chapters must follow templates in `templates/`
2. **Follow VM0033 Integration**: Use `vm0033-integration/` system for all methodology references
3. **Link Guardian Docs**: Follow `guardian-integration/` patterns for existing documentation

### For Part Maintainers

1. **Reference Shared Systems**: Link to shared infrastructure rather than duplicating
2. **Contribute Improvements**: Enhance shared systems for all parts
3. **Validate Compliance**: Ensure part-specific content follows shared standards
4. **Report Issues**: Identify and report shared system improvements needed

## Integration with Parts

Each part should reference these shared systems:

```markdown
<!-- In each part's README.md -->
## Content Development Guidelines

This part follows the shared handbook infrastructure:
- **Templates**: [Shared Templates](../_shared/templates/README.md)
- **VM0033 Integration**: [VM0033 System](../_shared/vm0033-integration/README.md)
- **Guardian Integration**: [Guardian System](../_shared/guardian-integration/README.md)
```

## Maintenance

### Shared System Updates

* Updates to shared systems benefit all parts automatically
* Version control ensures consistency across handbook
* Centralized maintenance reduces duplication

### Quality Assurance

* Shared validation ensures consistent quality
* Common testing procedures across all parts
* Unified standards and guidelines
