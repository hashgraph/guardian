**Note:**

‘**Force New Document**’ option has been removed as its usage resulted in the duplicate documents (with the same hashes) polluting the storage and causing confusion in the links (when building trust chain). For the cases when a new document needs to be created on the basis of the old one please use ’**reassigningBlock**’ which would create new _proof_ and as result new document with the equivalent content but with a new hash.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Auto Property:

This option applied in most cases. When **Auto** is selected the system applies the following logic:

1\. If the hash of the new document (being saved) is different from the hash of the document then it is based on the message is sent to Hedera into the Policy Instance Topic.

2\. If the database contains another document with the same hash it gets refreshed, otherwise a new document is created in the database.

RefreshEvents are used to refreshing the UI, instead of "dependencies" property.
